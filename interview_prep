Tip for You (Interview Prep)

Since this JD mentions Elixir + Kafka + AWS, expect questions on:

Ruby vs Elixir (OOP vs Functional)

Kafka consumers, partitions, offsets

AWS basics (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM)

Docker + CI/CD (Jenkins pipelines)

If you want, I can:

Map JD → likely interview questions

Create a 30-day Elixir crash plan

Help you write a tailored resume summary for this JD




########


7️⃣ Quick Connections to Your JD

Ruby / Elixir apps can store user uploads or reports in S3

CloudFront + S3 → fast content delivery

Logs from EC2, RDS, Kafka can be archived to S3

If you want, I can next cover S3 vs EBS vs EFS vs RDS storage in one easy table, which is another classic interview trap.

Do you want me to do that?

######

Likely Follow-Up Questions
Be ready for:

👉 What should we hit next?


#####

If you want, next we can do:

Jenkins pipeline stages

Failure handling & rollbacks

Kafka basics (still in your JD)

👉 What’s next?


You’re now asking architect-level questions — this is very strong 💪

Next Kafka topics interviewers usually ask:

Topics & partitions (simple)

Consumer groups

Exactly-once vs at-least-once

👉 Which one do you want next?


Bonus (If interviewer probes)

“Kafka allows multiple consumers to read the same event independently.”

Next likely Kafka questions:

What is a topic?

What is a partition?

What is a consumer group?

👉 Which one next?

Comparison with Redis locks

###

1️⃣ Redis persistence (RDB vs AOF)
2️⃣ Redis transactions & atomicity
3️⃣ Redis pub/sub
4️⃣ Redis + Rails caching best practices

###

🧠 How Sidekiq stores queues in Redis (lists)

🔁 Retry vs dead queue

⚙️ sidekiq.yml vs CLI config

💥 Starvation problems & best practices

🧪 MCQs with traps


####


🔁 Retry & dead queue

⏰ Scheduled jobs (perform_in)

⚙️ Sidekiq vs ActiveJob callbacks

🧠 MCQs interview style

🧪 Real Redis data structure for queues

###

jobs are pushed to redis by active job???

###########

scenarios multiple users has created report generation

but there are multiple threads

and we can want each user should have report, solve how?
