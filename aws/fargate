1️⃣ What is Fargate

AWS Fargate is:

A serverless compute engine for containers that runs tasks without you managing EC2 instances.

In other words:

You just provide container + task definition

AWS provides the compute, networking, and scaling

No EC2 instance to manage

2️⃣ Why use Fargate (advantages)
✅ 1. No server management

You don’t provision, patch, or monitor EC2

ECS just launches tasks

✅ 2. Automatic scaling

CPU/memory-based scaling of tasks

Handles spikes automatically

✅ 3. Isolation

Each task gets its own network namespace and compute

Safer for multi-tenant workloads

✅ 4. Pay for what you use

Only pay for vCPU + memory per running task

No idle EC2 instances

✅ 5. Simplifies CI/CD

Jenkins + Docker + Fargate = deploy tasks without touching servers

✅ 6. Integration with AWS services

CloudWatch logs

ALB/NLB

Secrets Manager

IAM roles per task

3️⃣ Fargate vs ECS on EC2 (common trap)
| Feature             | ECS on EC2                        | ECS on Fargate                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Who manages servers | You                               | AWS                                |
| Scaling             | You define scaling of EC2 + tasks | Just tasks; compute managed by AWS |
| Isolation           | Shared EC2                        | Task-level isolation               |
| Cost                | EC2 billed 24/7                   | Pay per running task               |

🔥 Interview line:

“Fargate removes the operational overhead of managing EC2 instances, letting us focus purely on deploying and scaling containers.”

4️⃣ How it fits your Rails + Elixir system

Rails API → Fargate service

Elixir Kafka consumer → Fargate service

Auto-restart & auto-scale independently

ECS ensures tasks are running, while OTP inside Elixir handles process-level crashes

5️⃣ One-sentence interview answer

“We use Fargate because it allows running containers without managing EC2 servers, providing auto-scaling, isolation, and integration with AWS services, while letting us focus on application logic.”
