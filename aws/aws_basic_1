###########

AWS is a cloud platform that provides on-demand compute, storage, networking, and managed services to build scalable applications.

###

	🖥 EC2 — Compute

	Virtual servers.

	Use case:

	Run Rails / Phoenix app
	Docker containers
	Background workers

	Interview line:

	“EC2 is used to run application servers and workers.”



####

📦 S3 — Object Storage

	Files
	Images
	Logs
	Backups

Key points:

Highly durable
Cheap
Not a database

Say this:

“S3 is used for static assets and file storage.”

####RDS — Managed Database

	PostgreSQL
	MySQL

	Why RDS?

	Backups
	Replication
	Monitoring

	Interview line:

	“RDS removes operational overhead for relational databases.”


###	🔐 IAM — Security (VERY IMPORTANT)

Controls:
Who can access what
Roles > users for services

Golden line:
“AWS IAM uses roles and policies to provide least-privilege access.”


####  Scaling in AWS (Connect to Elixir!)

Vertical scaling:
	Bigger EC2 instance

Horizontal scaling:
	More EC2 instances

	Auto Scaling Group

	Adds/removes instances based on load

	Say this:

	“Auto Scaling allows the system to handle traffic spikes automatically.”



##### Load Balancing (Almost always asked)

ALB (Application Load Balancer)

Routes traffic to multiple EC2 instances
Health checks

Interview line:

“ALB distributes traffic and removes unhealthy instances.”

######	Docker on AWS (Your JD mentions Docker)

Typical setup
Client → ALB → EC2 → Docker → App


Docker ensures:
Same environment
Easy deployments

Say:

“Docker provides consistent environments across development and production.”


######CI/CD – Jenkins + AWS
Flow
GitHub → Jenkins → Build Docker image → Deploy to EC2


Jenkins:

Runs tests
Builds images
Deploys

Interview line:

“Jenkins automates build, test, and deployment pipelines.”


####### Messaging / Kafka on AWS (High relevance)

Kafka options:

Self-hosted on EC2

MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka)

Say:

“AWS MSK provides managed Kafka with less operational overhead.”


####  Security Basics (Don’t skip)
Best practices

No hard-coded credentials
Use IAM roles

Security Groups as firewall

Golden line:

“Security Groups act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic.”

How Elixir + AWS scale together (IMPRESSIVE)
Architecture
ALB
 ↓
Multiple EC2 nodes (Phoenix / Elixir)
 ↓
Millions of lightweight processes


Say this:

“AWS scales infrastructure horizontally, while Elixir scales concurrency within each node.”

🔥 This connects AWS + Elixir beautifully.

“In AWS, our application runs on EC2 instances behind a load balancer, uses RDS for data storage, S3 for files, IAM for security, and Auto Scaling for traffic spikes. Docker and Jenkins help ensure reliable deployments.”
