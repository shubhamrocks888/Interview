What is a Load Balancer? (1 line)

A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve availability and scalability.

✅ Pros of Load Balancer

1️⃣ High Availability

	If one server goes down, traffic is sent to others

	No single point of failure

	2️⃣ Scalability

		Can add/remove servers without changing client behavior

		Works well with Auto Scaling

	3️⃣ Better Performance

		Distributes load evenly

		Prevents any one server from being overloaded

	4️⃣ Health Checks

		Automatically stops sending traffic to unhealthy servers

	5️⃣ Security

		Servers are not exposed directly to the internet

		SSL termination at the load balancer

❌ Cons of Load Balancer

1️⃣ Additional Cost

Load balancers are not free

2️⃣ Extra Complexity

More components to configure and manage

3️⃣ Single Point if Misconfigured

If not set up across multiple AZs, it can become a bottleneck

4️⃣ Latency (Small)

One extra network hop (usually negligible)

5️⃣ Session Handling Issues

Sticky sessions can reduce scalability if used incorrectly

⚖️ When should you use a Load Balancer?

✔ When:

Multiple servers

High availability required

Traffic is unpredictable

❌ Not necessary when:

Single internal tool

Low traffic, non-critical app

🎯 Interview-Perfect Answer (Memorize)

“A load balancer improves availability and scalability by distributing traffic across multiple servers and routing requests only to healthy instances. The trade-offs are additional cost and system complexity.”

🔥 One-liner follow-up (if asked)

“For production systems, the benefits of a load balancer usually outweigh the downsides.”

A load balancer improves availability and scalability

#### what does availability means here?

Perfect, let’s make “availability” crystal clear — this comes up almost every time.

🔹 Availability (in this context)

Availability means how much of the time your application is up and accessible to users.

Usually measured as uptime %

Example: 99.99% availability → ~52 minutes of downtime per year

In the context of a load balancer:

EC2 instances may fail or go down for maintenance

Load balancer routes traffic to healthy instances

Users can still access the app → high availability

Simple analogy

Without LB: single server → server goes down → app is down → users can’t access

With LB: multiple servers → one fails → LB sends users to others → app stays up

Key point for interview:

“Availability is about keeping the application reachable for users, even if some servers fail.”

💡 Golden interview line you can memorize:

“In AWS, a load balancer improves availability by routing traffic only to healthy instances across multiple servers and AZs, ensuring the app stays accessible even if some servers fail.”

If you want, I can next explain scalability in one simple line, so you can pair availability vs scalability for your answer tomorrow.
