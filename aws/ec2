EC2 stands for:

Elastic Compute Cloud

How to say it in an interview (best way):

“EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud, which provides scalable virtual servers in AWS.”

	Why Elastic matters (bonus point):

	You can scale up or down
	On-demand capacity
	Pay only for what you use


#########
Why do we use EC2?

To run applications without managing physical hardware, with the ability to scale on demand.


#######
What is an EC2 instance?

A virtual machine running on AWS infrastructure.

####
What is an AMI?

AMI = Amazon Machine Image

A template used to launch EC2 instances, containing the OS, runtime, and application setup.

####

What are instance types?

Predefined combinations of CPU, memory, and networking (e.g., t3, m5).

Example:

t3 → general purpose

c → compute optimized

r → memory optimized

########

What is an Availability Zone?

An isolated data center within an AWS region.

Why important?

For high availability and fault tolerance.


########


How do you secure an EC2 instance?

Using Security Groups and IAM roles.

Security Group → network-level firewall

IAM Role → permission to access AWS services

######

What is a Security Group?

A virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.

####

What is Auto Scaling?

Automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on traffic or CPU usage.

#####

What is a Load Balancer used for?

To distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

######

What is EBS?

EBS = Elastic Block Store

Persistent block storage attached to EC2 instances.

########

What happens if an EC2 instance stops?

Instance stops

EBS data remains

Public IP may change

####

Difference between EC2 stop vs terminate?
Stop	Terminate
Instance stops	Instance deleted
Data persists	Data lost

###

EC2 provides scalable virtual machines that can be secured with IAM and Security Groups, scaled using Auto Scaling, and made highly available using Load Balancers across multiple Availability Zones.”
