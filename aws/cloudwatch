1️⃣ What is CloudWatch?

CloudWatch is AWS’s monitoring and observability service.
It collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources and applications so you can monitor, alert, and troubleshoot your systems.

2️⃣ What can CloudWatch monitor?

1️⃣ Metrics → Numerical data over time

CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, network traffic

EC2, RDS, Lambda, ELB, custom metrics

2️⃣ Logs → Application or system logs

Rails / Phoenix app logs

Error logs, access logs

3️⃣ Events → AWS system or custom events

Auto Scaling events, EC2 state changes

3️⃣ Why use CloudWatch?

Visibility → Know how your system is performing

Alerts → Get notified if CPU, memory, or errors exceed threshold

Troubleshooting → Analyze logs to find issues

Automation → Trigger actions via CloudWatch Alarms

4️⃣ CloudWatch Components
Component	Purpose
Metrics	Track numeric performance (CPU, memory, requests/sec)
Logs	Store application and system logs
Alarms	Notify when metrics cross thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%)
Dashboards	Visualize metrics & logs in one place
Events	Respond to system or custom events
5️⃣ Example Use Case

Scenario: Rails/Phoenix app on EC2 + RDS

Metrics: CPU usage of EC2, read/write IOPS of RDS

Logs: Application errors (log/production.log)

Alarms: CPU > 80% → send Slack / trigger Auto Scaling

Dashboard: Combine EC2 + RDS metrics for overall health

6️⃣ Pros & Cons (Simple Version)
✅ Pros

Centralized monitoring for AWS resources

Works with custom application metrics

Can trigger automated actions

Scales with AWS infrastructure

❌ Cons

AWS-only by default (requires extra setup for on-prem)

Cost increases with high log retention or metrics

7️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer (Memorize)

“AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring service that collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources and applications. It helps us track performance, set alarms for critical thresholds, troubleshoot issues, and automate responses to maintain system reliability.”

🔹 Quick One-Liners

Metrics: CPU, memory, network

Logs: Application/system errors

Alarms: Notify or trigger actions

Dashboards: Visual overview of system health
