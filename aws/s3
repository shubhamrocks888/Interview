1️⃣ What is S3?

S3 is an object storage service in AWS used to store files, images, backups, logs, and static assets.

Objects = files + metadata

Stored in buckets

Highly durable (99.999999999% – “11 9s”)


2️⃣ Key Features

	1️⃣ Durability & Reliability

	Stores objects across multiple AZs automatically

	2️⃣ Scalability

	Handles virtually unlimited storage

	Auto scales with usage

	3️⃣ Security

	IAM policies & bucket policies

	Encryption at rest (SSE) and in transit (HTTPS)

	4️⃣ Versioning

	Keep multiple versions of the same object

	Useful for recovery

	5️⃣ Lifecycle Management

	Auto move objects to cheaper storage (S3 Glacier)


3️⃣ Use Cases

	Static assets for web apps (images, CSS, JS)

	Backups & logs

	Data lake / big data storage

	Hosting simple static websites

4️⃣ How S3 Works (Simple Architecture)
	Client → S3 Bucket → Object (file + metadata)


	Key = unique file name

	Bucket = container for objects

	💡 Each object is immutable (can’t partially update; must overwrite)

5️⃣ Pros & Cons (Simple Version)
	
	✅ Pros

	Highly durable & available

	Unlimited storage

	Easy to scale

	Secure & configurable

	Cost-effective

	❌ Cons

	Not a database → can’t do queries like SQL

	Eventual consistency for overwrite/delete in old versions (not a big issue for most apps)

6️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer (Memorize)

	“AWS S3 is a highly durable and scalable object storage service used to store files, logs, backups, and static assets. It provides security, versioning, and lifecycle management, and is commonly used in web applications for storing images, videos, and static content.”

🔹 1️⃣ What is an S3 Bucket?

A bucket is a container in S3 where you store your objects.

Think of it like a folder in the cloud, but:

Buckets have globally unique names (across all AWS accounts)

You can set permissions, policies, and region per bucket

Example:

Bucket name: myapp-uploads

Region: ap-south-1

🔹 2️⃣ What is an S3 Object?

An object is the actual file stored in a bucket.

Objects can be any file: image, video, JSON, CSV, logs

Each object has:

Data (the content)

Metadata (info about the object, e.g., size, content-type)

Key (unique identifier)

Example:

File: profile_pic.png

Stored in bucket: myapp-uploads

🔹 3️⃣ What is the Key?

The key is the unique name for an object in a bucket.

Combined with the bucket name → unique address of the object

Example:

Bucket: myapp-uploads
Key: users/123/profile_pic.png


Full S3 URL:

https://myapp-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/users/123/profile_pic.png

Bucket	Folder / container
Object	File inside the folder
Key	File path / filename
🔹 5️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer (Memorize)

“In S3, a bucket is a container for storing objects. An object is the file stored in the bucket, and each object has a key, which is its unique name or path inside the bucket.”



######

What “Objects are immutable” means

Once you upload an object to S3, you cannot modify it in place.

If you want to “change” it, you have to upload a new version or overwrite the existing object.

S3 stores each version as a separate object if versioning is enabled.

Example

Bucket: myapp-uploads
Key: users/123/profile_pic.png

1️⃣ Upload profile_pic.png → S3 stores it
2️⃣ You want to change it → edit locally and upload again to same key
3️⃣ Old file replaced (or stored as old version if versioning enabled)

Why this matters

No partial updates → simpler storage system

High durability & consistency

Works well with cloud architecture and multiple AZs

🔹 Optional: Versioning

If versioning enabled, S3 keeps all versions

You can recover previous versions if needed

Example:

users/123/profile_pic.png → v1
users/123/profile_pic.png → v2

🔹 Interview-Perfect Answer

“S3 objects are immutable, meaning once a file is uploaded, it cannot be modified in place. To update it, you overwrite the object or upload a new version if versioning is enabled.”
