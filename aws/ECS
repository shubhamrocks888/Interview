Two different meanings are getting mixed

You’re mixing:

Docker containers

EC2 instances

They are not 1:1.

Case 1️⃣ ECS on EC2 (classic model)
What happens

You create EC2 instances

ECS schedules containers on them

Multiple containers can run on one EC2 instance

Example
EC2 Instance
   |
   +── Rails container
   +── Elixir container
   +── Kafka sidecar (maybe)


✅ Yes — Rails and Elixir can run on the same EC2

Case 2️⃣ ECS with Fargate (modern & preferred)
What happens

No EC2 instances visible to you

Each ECS task gets its own isolated compute

You don’t manage servers

Example
Fargate
   |
   +── Rails task (container)
   |
   +── Elixir task (container)


❌ They do not share EC2
❌ You don’t even see the EC2

🔥 Interview preference:

“Most production systems use ECS with Fargate for isolation and simplicity.”

Important distinction: Task vs Container
ECS Task

Can contain one or more containers

Containers in the same task:

Share network

Share lifecycle

Example (rare but possible):
Task
  ├── Rails container
  └── Elixir container


⚠️ This is usually NOT recommended unless tightly coupled.

Best practice (interview-safe)
Usually:

Rails → one ECS service

Elixir → another ECS service

Scale independently

Deploy independently

ECS Cluster
   |
   +── Rails Service (N containers)
   |
   +── Elixir Service (M containers)

Why NOT put both in same container
Reason	Explanation
Scaling	Rails & Elixir scale differently
Deployments	Independent deploys
Crashes	Isolation
Resources	Different CPU/memory profiles

🔥 Interview line:

“Microservices should be independently deployable and scalable.”

Final corrected statement (use this)

Say this in interview:

“Rails and Elixir services run as separate containers, potentially on the same EC2 instance when using ECS on EC2, or on isolated infrastructure when using Fargate.”

That answer is perfect.
