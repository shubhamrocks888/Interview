This is a classic interview question, and the key is to explain it clearly, not deeply.

I’ll give you:
1️⃣ Simple definition
2️⃣ Core differences
3️⃣ When to use which
4️⃣ Interview-ready answer

1️⃣ EC2 vs ECS — one-line definitions
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud.

You manage:

OS

Patching

Docker installation

Process management

ECS (Elastic Container Service)

ECS is a managed service to run Docker containers.

You manage:

Containers

Task definitions

Scaling rules

AWS manages:

Scheduling

Restarts

Infrastructure (especially with Fargate)

2️⃣ Key difference (mental model)

EC2 gives you machines.
ECS gives you a platform to run containers on machines.

3️⃣ Comparison table (interview-friendly)
Feature	EC2	ECS
What it is	Virtual machine	Container orchestration
Level	Infrastructure	Platform
You manage	OS, Docker, apps	Containers only
Scaling	Manual / ASG	Automatic
Restart on crash	You handle	ECS handles
Deployment	SSH / scripts	Task definitions
Best for	Full control	Microservices
4️⃣ How they work together (IMPORTANT)

ECS runs on top of EC2 or Fargate.

EC2  ← compute
ECS  ← container scheduler
Docker ← app packaging


So:

ECS does not replace EC2

ECS uses EC2

5️⃣ ECS launch modes (very important)
ECS + EC2

You create EC2 instances

ECS places containers on them

More control, more ops

ECS + Fargate

No EC2 management

AWS handles everything

Most modern choice

🔥 Interview line:

“ECS with Fargate removes the need to manage EC2 instances.”

6️⃣ Where Rails & Elixir fit
EC2 approach (old school)

SSH into server

Run Rails + Elixir manually

Handle restarts yourself

ECS approach (modern)

Rails container as ECS service

Elixir container as ECS service

Auto-restart, auto-scale

7️⃣ When to use EC2 directly

Use EC2 if:

You need full OS control

Legacy apps

Custom networking / kernel tweaks

8️⃣ When to use ECS

Use ECS if:

Microservices

Dockerized apps

Independent scaling

CI/CD pipelines

9️⃣ One-sentence interview answer (perfect)

Say this:

“EC2 provides virtual machines, while ECS is a managed service that orchestrates Docker containers, often running on EC2 or Fargate to simplify deployment, scaling, and recovery.”

10️⃣ Extra credit (OTP connection)

🔥 If you want to impress:

“ECS handles container-level fault tolerance, while Elixir’s OTP handles process-level fault tolerance inside the container.”
