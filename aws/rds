What is RDS?

RDS is a managed relational database service in AWS.
It supports databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server, and handles the operational heavy-lifting for you.

Key point: You don’t manage OS, backups, replication — AWS does it.

2️⃣ Why use RDS instead of self-managed DB on EC2?
		
		Self-managed DB (EC2)							RDS
		
		Install, configure, patch OS & DB yourself		AWS handles OS & DB setup, patches, backups
		Manual backups & monitoring						Automated backups & monitoring
		Manual replication for HA						Multi-AZ replication built-in
		Harder to scale									Easy to scale vertically & read replicas for horizontal read 	                                                 scaling


Interview line:

	“RDS reduces operational overhead and improves reliability.”


#########  Key Features You Must Know

1️⃣ Multi-AZ deployment → Fault tolerance

Primary DB in one AZ, standby in another AZ

Automatic failover if primary fails

2️⃣ Read Replicas → Scalability

Offload read-heavy workloads

Can be in same or different region

3️⃣ Automated backups & snapshots → Recovery

Daily backups + point-in-time recovery

4️⃣ Security

VPC isolation

Encryption at rest (KMS) & in transit (SSL)

5️⃣ Monitoring

CloudWatch metrics for CPU, memory, connections, etc.

High Availability vs Scalability in RDS

Aspect	How RDS Helps

High Availability				Multi-AZ deployment → automatic failover
Scalability						Read replicas → offload read queries, vertical scaling → bigger instance

Golden line:

“RDS handles HA via Multi-AZ and scales reads via read replicas.”


5️⃣ Common RDS Interview Traps

# Single AZ vs Multi-AZ

	Single AZ → downtime if AZ fails

# Multi-AZ → automatic failover → HA

	Read Replica vs Multi-AZ

# Read Replica → scalability (read-only)

	Multi-AZ → fault tolerance & HA

# RDS instance stops vs terminates

	Stop → retains data, can start later

	Terminate → data deleted unless snapshot taken

# Backup retention period

Usually configurable (1–35 days)


###  Interview-Perfect Answer (Memorize)

“AWS RDS is a managed relational database service that handles patching, backups, and replication. Multi-AZ deployments provide high availability by automatically failing over to a standby instance, while read replicas allow horizontal scaling for read-heavy workloads.”

🔥 Bonus One-Liner (Strong)

“RDS reduces operational overhead, ensures fault tolerance, and provides easy scalability for cloud applications.”


######  RDS Multi-AZ vs Read Replica

| Feature             | Multi-AZ Deployment                 | Read Replica                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | High availability / fault tolerance | Read scalability                   |
| **Data flow**       | Synchronous replication             | Asynchronous replication           |
| **Writes allowed?** | Yes, only to primary                | No, read-only                      |
| **Failover**        | Automatic if primary fails          | Not for failover (used for reads)  |
| **AZ/Region**       | Usually same region, different AZ   | Can be same or different region    |
| **Use case**        | Prevent downtime due to AZ failure  | Offload read-heavy queries         |
| **Cost**            | Higher (standby instance running)   | Additional instance cost for reads |
