Interview-ready definitions (use one of these)
Simple

Hooks are functions that let us use React features inside function components.

Slightly detailed

Hooks allow function components to manage state, perform side effects, access context, and control component behavior without using classes.

One-liner (very good)

Hooks replace class components by enabling state and lifecycle features in function components.
