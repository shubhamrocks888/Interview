🧩 Step 1: useState (FROM ABSOLUTE ZERO)
❓ Why useState?

Function components were stateless before hooks.

function Counter() {
  let count = 0; // ❌ resets on every render
}


React needed a way to persist data between renders.

🧠 What is State?

State is data that belongs to a component and changes over time.

Examples:

counter value

form input

toggle (open/close)

API response

✅ useState syntax
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

Example
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      {count}
    </button>
  );
}

🔍 What happens internally (important)

Component renders

useState(0) runs

React stores count = 0

setCount(1) called

React re-renders component

useState returns updated value

👉 State is preserved between renders

⚠️ Common mistakes
❌ Direct mutation
count = count + 1; // ❌

✅ Correct
setCount(count + 1);

❌ Using old state
setCount(count + 1);
setCount(count + 1);

✅ Correct (functional update)
setCount(c => c + 1);
setCount(c => c + 1);

🎯 Interview questions (useState)

Q: Why useState doesn’t update immediately?
A: State updates are batched for performance.

Q: Can we use multiple useState hooks?
A: Yes, unlimited.
