The syntax you’re confused about
() => setCount(count + 1)


This is just a JavaScript arrow function.

Step 1️⃣ What is ()?
()


It means a function with no parameters.

Same as:

function () {
}

Step 2️⃣ What is =>?

=> means arrow function (ES6).

So:

() => {
  // function body
}

Step 3️⃣ What is setCount(count + 1)?

count → current state value

setCount → function to update state

count + 1 → new value

Equivalent to:

setCount(count + 1);

Step 4️⃣ Combine everything
() => setCount(count + 1)


Means:

A function that, when called, increases count by 1

Same as writing:

function increment() {
  setCount(count + 1);
}

Why do we need a function here?
❌ Wrong
<button onClick={setCount(count + 1)}>


This runs immediately during render ❌

✅ Correct
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>


Because:

onClick expects a function

React calls it only when user clicks

Even simpler example (pure JS)
const sayHi = () => console.log("Hi");


Calling it:

sayHi(); // prints Hi


Same pattern:

const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);

React-friendly best practice (important)

Instead of:

() => setCount(count + 1)


Prefer:

() => setCount(prev => prev + 1)

Why?

Because React state updates are async and batched.

setCount(prev => prev + 1);


Means:

“Give me the latest value and increment it”

Mental model 🧠
() => setCount(count + 1)


=
➡️ “When event happens, update state”

Interview explanation (short)

This syntax is an arrow function passed as a callback, so state updates only happen when the event occurs, not during render.
