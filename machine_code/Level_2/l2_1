class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :tasks, dependent: :destroy

  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true,
                    format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
  validates :name, presence: true
end



class Task < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :status, inclusion: { in: %w[pending in_progress completed] }
  validates :due_date, presence: true
end
