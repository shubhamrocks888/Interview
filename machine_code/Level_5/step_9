🚀 Next Part (Real-World Upgrade)

Let’s now move from “Book My Show Lite” to something more realistic.

🎯 Next Feature: Seat-Level Booking (Instead of seat count)

Right now we book:

seats_booked = 3


But real systems don’t book “3 random seats”.

They book:

["A1", "A2", "A3"]

Why This Is Important

Your current system:

Only tracks available_seats

Does NOT track which exact seats are booked

Cannot prevent two users booking the same seat number

That’s not how real booking systems work.

🎬 Real Upgrade Design

We introduce a new model:

Seat Model

Fields:

show_id

seat_number (A1, A2, B5, etc.)

status (available / booked)

Relationships:

Show has_many seats

Seat belongs_to show

Booking has_many seats (optional advanced)

Booking Flow Changes

Instead of:

Book 3 seats


We do:

Book seats: ["A1", "A2"]


New flow:

Lock selected seats

Check if all seats are available

Create booking

Mark seats as booked

Commit transaction

🔥 Interview-Level Question

Why is seat-level locking better than just decrementing available_seats?

Because:

Prevents double booking of same seat

Allows seat map UI

More realistic design

Better concurrency control

Your Turn

Do you want to:

1️⃣ Design Seat model first
OR
2️⃣ Modify existing booking logic to support seat numbers
OR
3️⃣ Discuss system design level (like how BookMyShow handles 1 lakh users concurrently)
