Requirements:

Fields: title, description, duration

Associations:

🧠 Think Before Writing

Should we delete shows if a movie is deleted? → Yes, use dependent: :destroy

Any callbacks needed? → Not for now

✍️ Task:

Write Movie model with:

has_many :shows

Validations as above

Paste your Movie model.
