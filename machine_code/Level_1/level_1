Relationship:

A User has many Posts

A Post belongs to a User

🎯 Endpoints To Implement
1️⃣ Create User with Posts (Nested Create)

POST /users

Should create user along with multiple posts

If any post invalid → nothing should save

Return created user with posts

2️⃣ List Posts with User Details

GET /posts

Return all posts

Each post should include:

id

title

status

user: { id, full_name, email }

⚠️ Avoid N+1 query problem.

3️⃣ Update Only Specific Post

PATCH /posts/:id

Allow updating:

title

status

Do NOT allow updating user_id

🎯 Bonus (If You Finish Early)

Add:

GET /posts?status=published

→ Should return only published posts
