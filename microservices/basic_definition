What are Microservices? (Simple definition)

Microservices architecture is a way of building an application as a collection of small, independent services,
where each service does one business task, runs independently, and communicates via APIs.

👉 Each service:

Has its own codebase

Often has its own database

Can be deployed independently

One-line interview definition ⭐

Microservices is an architecture where an application is divided into small, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability and communicating through APIs.

Example (Very Important for Interviews)
Monolith (Traditional App)
E-commerce App
 ├── User Management
 ├── Product Catalog
 ├── Orders
 ├── Payments


Single codebase

Single deployment

One bug can bring down everything

Microservices Version
User Service      → users DB
Product Service   → products DB
Order Service     → orders DB
Payment Service   → payments DB


Each service:

Runs separately

Can be scaled separately

Can be written in different languages (optional)

How services communicate

Mostly via:

HTTP/REST APIs

gRPC

Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

Example:

Order Service → calls → Payment Service API

Key Characteristics (Interviewer loves this list)

Independent deployment

Loosely coupled

Single responsibility

Own database per service

Technology agnostic

Scalable independently

Advantages of Microservices

✔ Scalability

Scale only the service that needs it (e.g., Payments on sale day)

✔ Faster development

Multiple teams can work independently

✔ Fault isolation

If Payment Service fails, Product Service still works

✔ Easier CI/CD

Deploy small changes without full redeploy

Disadvantages (Always mention this)

❌ Complexity

Many services = harder to manage

❌ Network latency

API calls are slower than method calls

❌ Data consistency

No easy joins across databases

❌ DevOps overhead

Needs Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring, logging

⚠️ Interview tip: Say “Microservices are not always better than monoliths”

Monolith vs Microservices (Quick Comparison)
Monolith	Microservices
Single codebase	Multiple services
Simple to start	Complex to manage
Hard to scale	Easy to scale
One deployment	Independent deployments
When should we use Microservices?

Use when:

Large application

Multiple teams

High scalability required

Frequent deployments

Avoid when:

Small app

Small team

Simple requirements

Common Interview Follow-up Questions

Be ready for these 👇

Why microservices instead of monolith?

How do services communicate?

How is data managed?

What challenges did you face?

How do you deploy microservices? (Docker/Kubernetes)

How do you handle failures? (Circuit breaker, retries)

30-second Interview Answer (Memorize This)

Microservices is an architectural style where an application is built as a set of small, independent services. Each service handles a specific business function, has its own database, and communicates with other services via APIs. This allows independent scaling, deployment, and better fault isolation, but increases operational complexity.-
