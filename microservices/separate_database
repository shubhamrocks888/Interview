Interview Answer (Direct)

It is not compulsory for every microservice to have its own database, but in a true microservices architecture, each service should own its data to avoid tight coupling.

Why “own database per service” is recommended
1️⃣ Loose coupling

If two services share the same database:

Schema changes affect multiple services

One service can break another

👉 This defeats the purpose of microservices.

2️⃣ Independent deployment

Each service can:

Change its schema

Migrate data

Deploy without coordination

3️⃣ Independent scaling

Order service might need high write throughput

User service might need heavy reads

Different DBs → different scaling strategies.

What happens if services share a database?

⚠️ This is often called a Distributed Monolith

Problems:

Tight coupling

Hard to deploy independently

Cross-service joins

One DB outage impacts all services

Interviewers don’t like this unless justified.

When sharing a database is acceptable

✔ Early-stage systems

Startup MVP

Small team

Low traffic

✔ Migration phase

Breaking monolith → microservices gradually

Temporary shared DB

✔ Read-only access

Service exposes data via API, not direct DB access

👉 Best practice:
Other services should access data only via API, not DB queries.

Correct Principle (Important Term)

📌 Database per Service

Each service is the single owner of its data, even if physically stored in the same DB server.

This means:

No other service directly reads/writes its tables

Communication happens via APIs/events

Physical DB vs Logical DB (Good Interview Point)
Logical Ownership	Physical DB
Required ✅	Optional ❌
Each service owns schema	Can be same DB instance
No cross access	Different schemas/tables

So you can say:

“Services may share the same DB instance, but not the same tables.”

How data consistency is handled then?

Since no joins:

API calls

Events (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

Eventual consistency

Saga pattern

15-Second Interview Answer (Best)

It’s not compulsory, but in microservices each service should logically own its data. Sharing databases creates tight coupling and turns the system into a distributed monolith. Services can share a DB instance but should never share tables.
