1️⃣ What is an ECS Task (simple)

An ECS Task is:

A running instance of a Task Definition.

Think of it like:

Task Definition = blueprint
Task            = running container(s)

2️⃣ What we define in a Task Definition (MOST IMPORTANT)

A Task Definition tells ECS how to run your container(s).

🔹 1. Docker image
Which image to run


Example:

Rails API image

Elixir notification image

🔹 2. CPU & Memory
How much compute this task needs


Example:

Rails: more memory

Elixir consumer: more CPU

🔹 3. Container port mapping
Which ports are exposed


Example:

Rails → 3000

Elixir → often none (background worker)

🔹 4. Environment variables
Runtime configuration


Examples:

DATABASE_URL

SECRET_KEY_BASE

KAFKA_BROKERS

🔥 Very important:

Never hardcode secrets — use env vars / AWS Secrets Manager

🔹 5. Command / entrypoint
What starts inside the container


Examples:

bundle exec puma

mix run --no-halt

🔹 6. IAM role (very important)
What AWS services this task can access


Examples:

S3

SQS

CloudWatch logs

🔥 Interview line:

“ECS tasks use IAM roles instead of access keys.”

🔹 7. Logging configuration
Where logs go


Usually:

CloudWatch Logs

🔹 8. Networking mode
How container gets network access


Most common:

awsvpc (each task gets its own IP)

🔹 9. Health checks
How ECS knows container is healthy


Example:

HTTP /health

Process running

3️⃣ One task → multiple containers? (rare but possible)

A task can define multiple containers.

Example:

Task
 ├── Rails container
 └── Nginx container


Used when:

Sidecar pattern

Log shippers

⚠️ Not for unrelated services.

4️⃣ Task vs Service (important distinction)
Task	Service
One run	Long-running
No auto-restart	Auto-restart
Jobs / batch	APIs / consumers

🔥 Interview tip:

“Services maintain desired count of tasks.”

5️⃣ How this maps to your system
Rails Task Definition

Image: rails-api

Port: 3000

Env: DB, secrets

Command: Puma

Elixir Task Definition

Image: elixir-consumer

CPU heavy

Command: mix run --no-halt

6️⃣ Common interview trap

❌ “Task is an EC2 instance”
❌ “Task is a container image”

✅ Task is a running container defined by task definition

7️⃣ One-sentence interview answer (perfect)

Say this:

“An ECS task definition specifies how to run a container, including the Docker image, CPU and memory, environment variables, networking, IAM permissions, logging, and startup commands.”
