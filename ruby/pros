✅ Pros of Ruby
1. Elegant & Readable Syntax

Ruby was designed for developer happiness.

Code reads almost like English, which makes it easy to understand and maintain.

# Easy to read
5.times do
  puts "Hello"
end


Pro: Faster development, fewer bugs, beginner-friendly.

2. Object-Oriented Everything

Every value in Ruby is an object, even numbers and booleans.

Supports classes, modules, mixins, inheritance, making it very flexible.

2.times { puts "Hi" }  # 2 is an object


Pro: Consistent OOP design; easy to extend.

3. Rich Standard Library

Ruby comes with a lot of built-in classes and modules.

Common tasks like HTTP requests, JSON parsing, file handling are easy.

require 'json'
JSON.parse('{"name":"Ruby"}')


Pro: Less need for external libraries for basic tasks.

4. Metaprogramming & DSLs

Ruby allows code that writes code dynamically.

Used heavily in Rails, RSpec, and other gems.

define_method(:greet) { puts "Hello" }
greet


Pro: Extremely flexible; allows creating DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages).

5. Mature Ecosystem

RubyGems provides thousands of libraries for almost everything.

Rails, Sinatra, and other frameworks make web development faster.

Pro: Rapid development, lots of community support.

6. Garbage Collected

Automatic memory management.

Developers don’t manually free memory.

Pro: Fewer memory leaks, easier coding.

7. Community & Documentation

Large, active community.

Lots of tutorials, guides, gems, StackOverflow answers.

Pro: Easy to find help and examples.
