slice in Ruby

slice is used to extract a part of an object.
It works on Array, String, and Hash.

1️⃣ Array#slice
👉 By index
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]

arr.slice(1)
# => 20

👉 By index + length
arr.slice(1, 2)
# => [20, 30]

👉 By range
arr.slice(1..3)
# => [20, 30, 40]

👉 Out of bounds
arr.slice(10)
# => nil


🧠 Important: slice does NOT modify the array.

2️⃣ String#slice
👉 By index
str = "hello"

str.slice(1)
# => "e"

👉 By index + length
str.slice(1, 3)
# => "ell"

👉 By range
str.slice(0..1)
# => "he"

👉 By regex
str.slice(/[aeiou]/)
# => "e"

👉 By regex + capture group
"abc123".slice(/(\d+)/)
# => "123"

3️⃣ Hash#slice (🔥 Rails favorite)
👉 Extract selected keys
hash = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

hash.slice(:a, :c)
# => { a: 1, c: 3 }


⚠️ Note:

Hash#slice is ActiveSupport (Rails), not pure Ruby

In plain Ruby you’d do:

hash.select { |k, _| [:a, :c].include?(k) }

4️⃣ slice vs [] (very common question)
arr[1, 2] == arr.slice(1, 2)
# => true


👉 slice is basically a method version of [].

5️⃣ Bang version: slice!
👉 Removes the elements
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

arr.slice!(1, 2)
# => [2, 3]

arr
# => [1, 4]


🔥 Interview tip:

slice → safe, non-mutating
slice! → mutates object

One-liner summary (interview-ready 💎)

slice extracts a portion of Array/String/Hash without modifying it, while slice! removes and returns the extracted part.
