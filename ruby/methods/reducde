🔹 What is reduce?

reduce accumulates a single value from a collection by applying a block to each element and carrying forward a “memo” (accumulator).

Think of it as folding an array into one value.

📌 Basic Syntax
collection.reduce(initial_value) do |memo, element|
  # compute new memo
end


memo → the running total (or result)

element → current item

initial_value → optional starting value; if omitted, first element is used

✅ Simple Examples
1️⃣ Sum of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

sum = numbers.reduce(0) { |total, n| total + n }

puts sum


Step by step:

total = 0, n = 1 → total + n = 1

total = 1, n = 2 → total + n = 3

total = 3, n = 3 → total + n = 6

total = 6, n = 4 → total + n = 10

➡ Output: 10

2️⃣ Product of numbers
numbers = [2, 3, 4]

product = numbers.reduce(1) { |prod, n| prod * n }
puts product


➡ Output: 24 (2 × 3 × 4)

3️⃣ Without initial value
numbers = [2, 3, 4]

sum = numbers.reduce { |total, n| total + n }


First element 2 is used as memo

Block starts with total = 2, n = 3

✅ Works fine, but safer to provide initial value to avoid errors on empty arrays.

4️⃣ Using Symbol Shortcut
[1, 2, 3, 4].reduce(:+)   # => 10
[2, 3, 4].reduce(:*)      # => 24


:+ → addition

:* → multiplication

Very concise and common in interviews.

5️⃣ Real-World Example
Count total projects for employees
total_projects = employees.values.reduce(0) do |sum, emp|
  sum + emp[:projects].size
end

puts total_projects


Iterates over each employee

Adds number of projects

Returns total

🧠 Key Points for Interviews

reduce is for folding/accumulating a single value

Can be sum, product, hash, array, string concatenation

Optional initial value is safer, especially for empty arrays

Symbol shortcut (:+, :*) makes code concise

Works on any Enumerable: Array, Hash, Range
