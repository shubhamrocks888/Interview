send/2 vs GenServer.call/2
High-level difference (say this first)

send is low-level, asynchronous message passing, while GenServer.call is a high-level, synchronous request–response abstraction built on top of message passing.

1️⃣ send(pid, message)
What it is

Primitive BEAM operation

Sends a message to a process’s mailbox

Does not wait for any response

Example
send(pid, {:event, data})

Key properties

🔹 Asynchronous (fire-and-forget)

🔹 No guarantee the message is handled

🔹 No built-in reply mechanism

🔹 Sender continues immediately

When to use

Event notifications

Logging

Metrics

Signals (no response needed)

Rails analogy

Like pushing a job to Sidekiq without caring about the result.

2️⃣ GenServer.call(pid, message)
What it is

OTP abstraction

Built on top of send/receive

Implements request–response

Example
GenServer.call(pid, {:get_state})

What happens internally

Sends a message to the GenServer

Caller blocks

GenServer processes message

GenServer sends a reply

Caller resumes

Key properties

🔹 Synchronous

🔹 Guarantees a reply (or timeout)

🔹 Safer for shared state access

🔹 Handles timeouts & failures

When to use

Reading state

Updating state and needing confirmation

Business logic that depends on result

Rails analogy

Like calling a service object and waiting for the return value.

3️⃣ Side-by-side comparison (MEMORIZE)
Feature	send	GenServer.call
Level	Low-level	High-level
Blocking	❌ No	✅ Yes
Reply	❌ Manual	✅ Built-in
Safety	Low	High
OTP compliant	❌	✅
4️⃣ What about GenServer.cast?

(Interviewers often check this next)

GenServer.cast(pid, {:increment, 1})


Asynchronous

No reply

OTP-managed

👉 Think of it as:

send with structure + safety

5️⃣ How to choose (INTERVIEW ANSWER)

I use GenServer.call when I need a reliable response or state consistency, and GenServer.cast or send for asynchronous events where I don’t need a reply.

6️⃣ Common follow-up questions (with answers)
❓ Can GenServer.call block forever?

No, it has a configurable timeout. If the GenServer doesn’t reply, the caller exits.

❓ Why not always use send?

Because it lacks structure, error handling, and reply guarantees. OTP abstractions make systems safer and easier to maintain.

7️⃣ One-liner summary (VERY IMPORTANT)

send is raw asynchronous messaging, while GenServer.call is a synchronous, OTP-managed abstraction that ensures safe request–response communication.

Final interview tip 🧠

If you explain:

Blocking vs non-blocking

Safety vs flexibility

OTP abstraction

👉 You sound like someone who understands Elixir design, not just syntax.
