### Elixir

1. Elixir is a functional, immutable language built on the Erlang VM (BEAM), designed for highly concurrent,
	fault tolerant systems.

2. 	Ruby vs Elixir (MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION)
	How to answer (memorize this)
	
	Ruby				Elixir
	Object-oriented		Functional
	Mutable objects		Immutable data
	Threads / GIL		Lightweight processes (BEAM)
	Exceptions			“Let it crash”
	Shared memory		Message passing

3.	Key line to say:

	“Elixir achieves concurrency using lightweight processes and message passing instead of shared mutable state.”

4.  Immutability (They WILL ask)
	Example

	list = [1, 2, 3]
	new_list = list ++ [4]


	📌 list is unchanged.

	Interview line:

	“In Elixir, data is immutable, so every transformation returns a new value, which avoids race conditions.”

5.  Elixir collections (basic)

	list: [1,2,3]

	map: %{name: "Shubham", age: 30}

	access: user.name


6. Concurrency (THIS IS WHY ELIXIR EXISTS)
	Core idea
	Thousands of lightweight processes

	Each process has its own memory

	Communicate via messages

	Example:
		spawn(fn ->
		  IO.puts("Hello from process")
		end)


		Say this confidently:

		“Elixir processes are not OS threads. They are lightweight and managed by the BEAM VM.”

7.		GenServer (High chance question)
		What is GenServer?

		A behavior for implementing server-like processes with state.

		Simple explanation

		Handles state

		Handles messages

		Runs in its own process

		Interview answer:

		“GenServer is used to manage stateful processes in a concurrent and fault-tolerant way.”

		No need to code unless asked.

8. 		OTP & “Let it crash” (VERY IMPRESSIVE if said)
		OTP stands for:

		Open Telecom Platform

		Core concepts:

		Supervisor

		Worker

		Restart strategies

		Golden line:

		“Instead of defensive coding, Elixir embraces ‘let it crash’ and uses supervisors to restart failed processes.”

		🔥 This line scores points.

9.	Phoenix vs Rails (if asked)
	
	Rails	Phoenix
	Monolith MVC	Lightweight, real-time friendly
	Thread based	Process based
	REST focused	WebSockets / LiveView

	Say:

	“Phoenix leverages BEAM concurrency, which makes it excellent for real-time systems.”


10.  Rapid-Fire Questions (Practice Now)

		Is Elixir object-oriented? ❌ (Functional)

		Mutable or immutable? ❌ Mutable → ✅ Immutable

		What is BEAM? → Erlang VM

		How does Elixir handle concurrency? → Processes + message passing

		What is pattern matching? → Matching data structure to variables

		What is GenServer? → Stateful process abstraction

		What is OTP? → Framework for fault tolerance

		Shared memory? ❌ No

		Exceptions? → Let it crash

		Why Elixir over Ruby? → Scalability & concurrency

		🎯 Final Interview Strategy (VERY IMPORTANT)

		If stuck → say this:

		“I’m still early in Elixir, but my strong Ruby background helps me understand functional concepts, concurrency models, and OTP design patterns.”

		This is completely acceptable.
