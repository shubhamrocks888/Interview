1️⃣ Why “parent” and “child” terminology exists

Because in BEAM/OTP:

Processes can start other processes and take responsibility for them.

That relationship is called:

Parent process → the one that starts

Child process → the one that is started

It’s about ownership and responsibility, not hierarchy of power.

2️⃣ Parent ≠ Caller ≠ Boss (important clarification)

A parent process:

Starts another process

May monitor or supervise it

Is notified if it crashes

A child process:

Runs independently

Has its own mailbox

Has no shared memory

❗ Child does not execute inside parent
❗ Child does not share variables
❗ Child does not block parent

3️⃣ Simple real-world analogy
Think of a company

Manager → Supervisor (parent)

Employee → Worker (child)

Manager:

Hires employee

Restarts work if employee leaves

Doesn’t do employee’s work

Employee:

Does the actual job

Can fail

Can be replaced

🔥 Interview line:

“Supervisors manage the lifecycle of worker processes, not their business logic.”

4️⃣ In plain Elixir code (very simple)
parent = self()

child =
  spawn(fn ->
    receive do
      :hello -> IO.puts("Hello from child")
    end
  end)

send(child, :hello)


Here:

parent spawned child

Parent knows child’s PID

Child runs independently

So we say:

Parent process

Child process

5️⃣ Why this matters (this is the real reason)
Because crashes propagate by links

In OTP:

Parent is linked to child

If child crashes → parent is notified

Supervisor decides what to do

Without this relationship:

You can’t restart safely

You can’t isolate failures

6️⃣ “Let it crash” depends on this

If everything was flat:

One crash = system crash

With parent-child:

Crash is contained

Restart is local

🔥 Interview sentence:

“Parent-child relationships allow failures to be isolated and recovered without bringing down the entire system.”

7️⃣ Rails comparison (important for you)

| Rails           | Elixir         |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Sidekiq process | Supervisor     |
| Job             | Worker process |
| Retry           | Restart child  |
| Redis           | Mailbox        |


Rails simulates this with infra
Elixir has it built into the runtime

8️⃣ Common misconception (clear this)

❌ “Child process is a function call”
❌ “Parent waits for child”

✅ Child is an OS-independent lightweight process
✅ Parent and child run concurrently

9️⃣ One-sentence answer (perfect interview answer)

Say this:

“The parent–child terminology exists because processes are started and monitored by other processes. This relationship enables supervision, failure isolation, and automatic recovery under the let-it-crash philosophy.”
