What is NoSQL?

	NoSQL = “Not Only SQL” — a type of database that doesn’t rely on traditional relational tables.

	Stores data in flexible ways, not just rows and columns

	Designed for high scalability, high throughput, and unstructured data

	Often used in microservices, real-time apps, and analytics pipelines

2️⃣ Why NoSQL is used in your stack

	Your system handles high-concurrency events (via Kafka)

	Events can be unstructured or semi-structured (e.g., order metadata, user actions, analytics events)

	NoSQL allows fast reads/writes and horizontal scaling

Example:

Order Service → creates order → produces event → stores summary in NoSQL DB
Analytics Service → reads from Kafka → writes aggregated metrics in NoSQL DB

3️⃣ Key Types of NoSQL


| Type              | Storage Model                 | Use Case Example                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Document DB**   | JSON-like documents           | MongoDB, CouchDB → store order metadata, user profiles |
| **Key-Value**     | Key → Value pairs             | Redis, DynamoDB → caching, session storage             |
| **Column-Family** | Columns grouped into families | Cassandra, HBase → analytics, time-series              |
| **Graph DB**      | Nodes & edges                 | Neo4j → social connections, recommendations            |

4️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer

“NoSQL databases are used for high-throughput, flexible, and scalable storage of unstructured or semi-structured data. In our stack, we could use DynamoDB or MongoDB to store event data from Kafka or aggregated analytics because they allow fast reads/writes and horizontal scaling, unlike traditional relational databases.”

5️⃣ Simple Analogy

SQL = spreadsheet → rows and columns

NoSQL = flexible filing cabinet → can store documents of different shapes and sizes, or just key-value pairs
