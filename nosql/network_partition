A network partition means nodes in a distributed system cannot communicate with each other.

What causes a network partition?

Network outage

Data center issue

Router/switch failure

Cloud AZ connectivity problem

Example:

Node A  ❌──────❌  Node B
Node C  ❌──────❌  Node D


Nodes are alive, but can’t talk to each other.

Why this matters in CAP theorem

When a partition happens, the system must choose:

Consistency → reject some requests

Availability → serve requests with possible stale data

You cannot avoid this choice.

One-line interview answer (perfect)

“A network partition occurs when nodes in a distributed system are unable to communicate with each other due to network failures.”

First: quick correction (important)

❌ “primary node not working”
❌ “secondary node not working”

In network partition, nodes may be working, but cannot communicate.

So the real question is:
👉 Does the node receiving the write have majority or not?

Assume a 3-node MongoDB replica set
Node A — Primary
Node B — Secondary
Node C — Secondary
Majority = 2 nodes

Case 1️⃣ Primary is isolated (no majority)
Primary (A) ❌ isolated
Secondary (B) ✅
Secondary (C) ✅

What happens?

Primary loses majority

MongoDB steps down the primary

❌ Writes are rejected

A new primary is elected from B or C

Result:

❌ Write request fails (temporarily)

✅ Consistency preserved

❌ Availability sacrificed

👉 MongoDB chooses Consistency

Case 2️⃣ One secondary is down / unreachable
Primary (A) ✅
Secondary (B) ❌
Secondary (C) ✅

What happens?

Majority still exists (A + C)

Primary remains primary

✅ Writes succeed

Secondary B catches up later

Result:

✅ Write request succeeds

✅ Availability maintained

✅ Consistency maintained

Case 3️⃣ Write request hits a secondary
Important rule:

MongoDB never allows writes on secondaries

What happens?

Secondary rejects write

Client is redirected to primary

Result:

❌ Write not accepted by secondary

✅ Correct behavior

Case 4️⃣ Partition splits cluster evenly (dangerous case)
A + B  |  C


A+B = majority → primary exists → writes succeed

C alone → no primary → writes rejected

👉 Prevents split-brain

Summary Table (Interview Gold)
Situation	Majority?	Write allowed?	Reason
Primary isolated	❌	❌	Prevent inconsistency
Secondary isolated	✅	✅	Majority exists
Write to secondary	—	❌	Writes only on primary
Majority side	✅	✅	Safe writes
One-line interview answer (memorize)

“In MongoDB, writes are only accepted by the primary and only when it has majority. If the primary loses majority during a network partition, writes are blocked to preserve consistency.”

Ultra-short mental model

No majority = no writes
