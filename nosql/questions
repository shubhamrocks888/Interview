4️⃣ Why NoSQL is Faster for Writes?

		Key points:

		No joins

		No foreign keys

		No locking across tables

		Append-heavy writes

		“NoSQL optimizes for write-heavy workloads common in event systems.”


5️⃣ Sharding vs Indexing (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Feature  | Indexing         | Sharding           |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Purpose  | Faster queries   | Scale data         |
| Scope    | Within node      | Across nodes       |
| Used for | Read performance | Horizontal scaling |



👉 Indexes don’t scale storage — shards do



6️⃣ How does MongoDB scale?

		Answer:

		Replica sets → high availability

		Sharding → horizontal scaling

		Indexes → query performance

7️⃣ How do you model data in NoSQL?

	“You design data based on access patterns, not normalization.”

	Example:

	Duplicate user data inside orders

	Avoid joins

	Optimize reads


8️⃣ Why NoSQL doesn’t support joins (mostly)?

“Joins are expensive in distributed systems because data is spread across nodes.”

9️⃣ When should you NOT use NoSQL?

Strong answer:

Financial transactions needing strict ACID

Complex reporting queries

Heavy relational logic


1️⃣0️⃣ NoSQL + Kafka (interviewer LOVES this)

	Kafka handles event streaming
	NoSQL handles event storage & querying

	Kafka ≠ Database
	NoSQL ≠ Message queue

	They complement each other.

🧠 INTERVIEWER SIGNALS (IMPORTANT)

If interviewer asks:

“Why” → talk architecture

“How does it scale” → sharding, partitioning

“Trade-offs” → consistency vs availability
