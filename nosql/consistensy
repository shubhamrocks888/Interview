1️⃣ What is Consistency (simple)

Consistency means: when you read data, you get the most recent correct value.

Example:

You update order_status = "shipped"

You immediately read it

Consistency = you see "shipped", not old data

2️⃣ Why consistency is hard in NoSQL

NoSQL databases are:

Distributed (multiple nodes)

Data is replicated

Network failures happen

So:

One node may have new data

Another node may still have old data

3️⃣ Strong Consistency

All reads return the latest write.

Writes are confirmed only after all required replicas update

Slower

Harder to scale

Example:

Banking transactions

Inventory count

SQL DBs → usually strongly consistent

4️⃣ Eventual Consistency (Very Common in NoSQL)

Reads may return stale data temporarily, but data becomes consistent over time.

Faster writes

Better availability

More scalable

Example:

Social media likes

Analytics dashboards

Order history showing after a few seconds

5️⃣ Read / Write Consistency (MongoDB example)

MongoDB lets you choose:

Write Concern

How many nodes must confirm a write

{ w: "majority" }

Read Concern

From where data is read (primary vs secondary)

6️⃣ AWS Example (Interview Gold)
DynamoDB

Default: eventual consistency

Optional: strongly consistent reads

You trade latency vs correctness

7️⃣ Consistency vs Availability (CAP)

During network failure:

Choose Consistency → some requests fail

Choose Availability → some reads may be stale

NoSQL usually chooses:

Availability + Partition tolerance

8️⃣ One-liner Interview Answer

“Consistency in NoSQL refers to whether reads always return the latest data. Most NoSQL systems favor eventual consistency to improve availability and scalability, though some allow tuning for strong consistency when needed.”

9️⃣ Super-short analogy

Strong consistency → asking the main office

Eventual consistency → asking nearby branches (they sync later)
