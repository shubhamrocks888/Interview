High availability does NOT guarantee zero data loss.
Fault tolerance does.

Why data loss can happen in High Availability

High availability focuses on:

Keeping the system up

Serving requests

Minimizing downtime

It does not always guarantee:

All writes are safely replicated before a failure

Example

Primary node receives a write

Before data replicates to secondary nodes

Primary crashes

Secondary takes over without that last write

➡️ System is available, but last data is lost

Fault Tolerance (contrast)

Fault tolerance ensures:

Data is replicated safely

System can recover without losing data

Writes are acknowledged only after replication

➡️ No data loss

| Feature              | High Availability | Fault Tolerance |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| System stays online  | ✅                 | ✅               |
| Handles node failure | ✅                 | ✅               |
| Data loss possible   | ⚠️ Yes            | ❌ No            |


“High availability ensures uptime, but it may allow some data loss. Fault tolerance ensures correctness and no data loss even during failures.”

First: what uptime & downtime mean

Uptime = time the system is available and serving requests

Downtime = time the system is unavailable

Example:

99.9% uptime ≈ ~8.7 hours downtime per year

99.99% uptime ≈ ~52 minutes downtime per year

Now, fix the misunderstanding 👇

❌ “In fault tolerance, uptime is 0”
✅ No — fault-tolerant systems also aim for very high uptime

Fault tolerance is not about being offline.
It’s about continuing to work correctly even when failures occur.

Correct comparison
High Availability (HA)

Goal: Minimize downtime

System stays online by:

Redirecting traffic

Failing over to another node

Might lose a small amount of data

Uptime: Very high
Downtime: Very small

Fault Tolerance (FT)

Goal: No data loss + correct behavior

System continues operating even during failures

Often requires:

More replicas

Synchronous replication

Stronger guarantees

Uptime: Very high (often same or better than HA)
Downtime: Near zero

Key correction (important for interview)

Fault tolerance is a superset of high availability, not the opposite.

All fault-tolerant systems are highly available

Not all highly available systems are fault-tolerant

One-line interview answer (memorize)

“High availability minimizes downtime, while fault tolerance ensures the system continues to operate correctly without data loss during failures — both aim for high uptime.”

Ultra-simple analogy

High availability → backup generator turns on quickly (lights may flicker)

Fault tolerance → lights never flicker at a
