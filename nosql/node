Short Answer (say this first)

A node in NoSQL is a database server (machine or instance) that stores and processes part of the data.

It can be:

A physical machine

A virtual machine (EC2)

A container (in some setups)

What exactly is a Node?

A node is:

One running instance of the NoSQL database software

With its own CPU, RAM, disk

Participates in a cluster

Example:

MongoDB Cluster
├── Node 1 (EC2 instance)
├── Node 2 (EC2 instance)
└── Node 3 (EC2 instance)


Each node:

Stores data

Serves read/write requests

Communicates with other nodes

Why NoSQL uses multiple nodes

Because NoSQL is built for:

Horizontal scaling

High availability

Fault tolerance

Instead of one big DB server → many smaller nodes.

Node vs Cluster (important distinction)
Term	Meaning
Node	One DB server
Cluster	Group of nodes working together

Cluster = multiple nodes

Types of nodes (MongoDB example)
1️⃣ Primary Node

Handles writes

Replicates data to others

2️⃣ Secondary Nodes

Replicate data

Can serve reads

Take over if primary fails

3️⃣ Arbiter (optional)

Voting only (no data)

Helps with leader election

Node in Sharded Cluster
Client
  ↓
Mongos (router)
  ↓
Shard 1 → Node A, Node B
Shard 2 → Node C, Node D


Each shard = subset of data

Each shard itself = replica set (multiple nodes)

Interview-friendly analogy

Node = one shop

Cluster = chain of shops

Sharding = each shop handles a different area

Replication = same shop copied in multiple places

AWS Context (important)

Node = EC2 instance running MongoDB

Or DynamoDB node (managed, abstracted)

Kubernetes → one node per pod sometimes

Perfect Interview Answer (memorize)

“A node in NoSQL is a database server instance that stores and processes part of the data. Multiple nodes form a cluster, allowing horizontal scaling, replication, and fault tolerance. Nodes can run on physical machines, virtual machines like EC2, or containers.”
