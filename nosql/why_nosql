1️⃣ Horizontal Scaling

	Definition: Ability to add more servers/nodes to handle more traffic or data.

	SQL (relational): Scaling usually means upgrading a single server (vertical scaling), which has limits.

	NoSQL: You can add more nodes to the cluster → data and load are distributed automatically.

	Example in your stack:

	Thousands of order events coming from Kafka every second

	DynamoDB or MongoDB can distribute data across multiple nodes

	No single node becomes a bottleneck

	Analogy:

	SQL = one big warehouse → if more items arrive, warehouse gets full

	NoSQL = multiple warehouses → add a new warehouse when demand grows



2️⃣ Flexible Schema for Event-Driven Data

		Definition: You don’t need a fixed table structure; each record can have different fields.

		SQL: You must define all columns in advance

		NoSQL: Each document/key-value pair can have different structure

		Example in your stack:

		Kafka produces events like:

		Order Created → {order_id, user_id, amount}

		Order Shipped → {order_id, shipment_id, shipped_at}

		NoSQL DB can store both without changing schema

		Analogy:

		SQL = Excel sheet → every row must have same columns

		NoSQL = filing cabinet → every folder can have different documents



3️⃣ Faster Writes for High-Concurrency Workloads

		Definition: NoSQL is optimized for fast inserts/updates, even with many simultaneous requests.

		SQL often requires locking rows/tables, which can slow down high-volume inserts

		NoSQL allows parallel writes without locking, improving throughput

		Example in your stack:

		Kafka produces thousands of order events per second

		Phoenix consumer writes events to NoSQL DB → fast, non-blocking writes

		System stays responsive under heavy load

		Analogy:

		SQL = one cashier handling everyone → lines form

		NoSQL = multiple cashiers (nodes) → everyone served quickly

✅ Interview-Perfect Answer

“NoSQL is preferred for high-concurrency, event-driven workloads because:

Horizontal scaling: we can add more nodes to handle more traffic,

Flexible schema: each event can have different fields without altering the structure,

Faster writes: it allows multiple concurrent writes without locking, ensuring the system stays responsive under load.”
