1️⃣ Throughput

Throughput = how many events/messages Kafka can handle per second.

In your orders example:

Thousands of users place orders at the same time

Kafka needs to handle all these order events quickly without slowing down

Partitions + parallel processing help increase throughput:

Each partition can be read/written independently

Multiple consumers process in parallel → more events processed per second

Simple analogy:

Throughput = how many letters the post office can handle per minute.

More mailboxes (partitions) → more letters delivered at the same time

2️⃣ Scalability

Scalability = how well the system can handle increased load by adding more resources.

In Kafka:

More partitions → more consumers → can process more events simultaneously

Can handle growth in traffic without slowing down the system

Example:

Today: 2 partitions, 2 consumers → 1000 orders/sec

Tomorrow: 10 partitions, 10 consumers → 5000 orders/sec

Same code, just add partitions & consumers

Simple analogy:

Scalability = hiring more postmen when the number of letters increases

3️⃣ How they relate to your example
Order Service → Kafka (orders topic) → Email / Analytics


High throughput:

Many users placing orders simultaneously

Kafka handles thousands of events per second

Scalability:

If traffic increases, add more partitions & consumers

Email Service and Analytics Service can scale independently

4️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer

“Throughput is how many events Kafka can handle per second. Scalability is how Kafka can handle increasing load by adding more partitions and consumers. In our orders example, Kafka achieves high throughput by processing multiple partitions in parallel, and it is scalable because we can add more consumers or partitions as traffic grows.”

✅ Key takeaway:

Throughput = speed of processing events

Scalability = ability to handle growth efficiently
