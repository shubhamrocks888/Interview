1️⃣ What is an “event” (very simple)

An event is:

A fact that something already happened in the system.

Not a command.
Not an instruction.
Just a statement of truth.

Example:

“UserSignedUp”

“OrderPlaced”

“NotificationRequested”

2️⃣ What does an event look like (concrete)

When Rails produces an event, it’s just data.

Example (JSON):

{
  "event_type": "notification_requested",
  "user_id": 123,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "template": "welcome",
  "occurred_at": "2026-01-18T10:00:00Z"
}


This is what Kafka stores.

Kafka doesn’t care what it means.
Kafka just stores bytes.

3️⃣ Why Rails produces an event instead of calling Elixir directly

This is the key architectural reason.

❌ Direct call (bad for this use case)
Rails → HTTP → Elixir


Problems:

Rails waits

Elixir down → Rails fails

No retry

Tight coupling

✅ Event-based (Kafka)
Rails → Kafka → Elixir


Benefits:

Rails responds immediately

Elixir can be slow or down

Event is durable

Can be retried

Can be consumed by many services

🔥 Interview line:

“Events decouple producers and consumers in time and availability.”

4️⃣ Why Elixir needs the event (this answers your question directly)

Elixir does not need Rails.
It needs information about what happened.

Elixir wants to know:

Who?

What?

When?

With what data?

The event carries that context.

Example:

Rails says: “A notification was requested.”

Elixir says: “Okay, I’ll send it asynchronously.”

5️⃣ Important: Event ≠ Business logic

Rails:

Decides that notification is needed

Applies business rules

Emits event

Elixir:

Reacts to event

Does the heavy async work

No business decision

🔥 Interview sentence:

“Rails emits domain events; Elixir reacts to them.”

6️⃣ Why Kafka stores the event (VERY IMPORTANT)

Kafka gives:

Feature	Why it matters
Durability	Event not lost
Ordering	Process in sequence
Replay	Reprocess if bug
Fan-out	Multiple consumers
Backpressure	Rails not blocked
7️⃣ Real-world failure example (interviewer favorite)

Scenario:

Rails sends notification

Elixir service is down

Without Kafka:
❌ Notification lost

With Kafka:
✅ Event stored
✅ Elixir comes back
✅ Event processed later

8️⃣ One-sentence interview answer (perfect)

Say this:

“An event represents a fact that occurred in the system. Rails emits events to Kafka to decouple business logic from asynchronous processing, allowing Elixir services to react reliably, independently, and at scale.”

That answer is very strong.

9️⃣ One more level (if interviewer pushes)

If they ask:

“Why not let Elixir decide when to send notifications?”

Answer:

“Rails owns business decisions, while Elixir focuses on high-concurrency execution. Events allow that separation of concerns.”
