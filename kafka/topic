1️⃣ What is a Kafka Topic?

A topic is like a category or feed name where events/messages are stored.

Producers publish messages to a topic

Consumers subscribe to a topic to read messages

Topics allow Kafka to organize and separate different kinds of events

2️⃣ Example with your scenario
Topics we might have:
Topic Name	What goes inside
orders	All order_created events
email_events	All email_sent events
analytics_events	Dashboard/analytics events
Flow Example:
Order Service (Producer)
        ↓ produces to "orders" topic
       Kafka Topic: "orders"
        ↓
Email Service (Consumer) → reads "orders" → sends email → produces "email_sent" to "email_events" topic
Analytics Service (Consumer) → reads "orders" → updates dashboard

3️⃣ Key points to remember

1️⃣ Topic = logical stream of events

Doesn’t depend on number of consumers

2️⃣ Multiple consumers can read the same topic independently

Email Service and Analytics Service both read orders topic

3️⃣ You can have multiple topics for different purposes

Keep events organized, easier to scale, and decouple services

4️⃣ Simple Analogy

Topic = mailbox label

“orders” → contains all order letters

“email_events” → contains all email letters

Producer = person drops letter into the correct mailbox (topic)

Consumer = person checks that mailbox when ready

5️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer

“A Kafka topic is a named stream of events. Producers publish messages to a topic, and consumers subscribe to it. In our example, the Order Service produces order_created events to the orders topic, and both Email Service and Analytics Service consume from it independently.”

✅ Bonus Tip

Always emphasize topic is logical, not tied to consumers

Multiple consumers can consume the same topic at different speeds
