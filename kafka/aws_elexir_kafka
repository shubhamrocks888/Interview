1️⃣ Kafka & AWS

You can run Kafka on AWS in multiple ways:

A) Self-managed Kafka on EC2

You spin up EC2 instances

Install Kafka manually or via Docker

Manage brokers, partitions, replication yourself

B) Managed Kafka via AWS MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka)

AWS handles cluster setup, scaling, and replication

You only produce and consume events from your application

Reduces operational overhead

C) Integration with other AWS services

S3 → Kafka for storing events

Lambda → consume Kafka events

RDS / DynamoDB → consume or produce events to Kafka

So Kafka is the event backbone, and AWS provides the infrastructure.

2️⃣ Kafka & Elixir

Elixir is very good at concurrency (lightweight processes) → ideal for working with Kafka:

Elixir processes (GenServers, Tasks) can act as Kafka consumers or producers

Each Elixir process can independently consume partitions

High concurrency + lightweight processes → can scale Kafka consumers efficiently

Libraries like Kaffe or BroadwayKafka make integration easy

3️⃣ Putting it together (your JD example)
Order Service (Elixir + Rails) → produces to Kafka (AWS MSK)
Kafka stores events → partitions on brokers
Consumers (Elixir processes or Rails services) → read events
Email Service → send emails
Analytics Service → update dashboards


AWS = infrastructure

Kafka = event/message bus

Elixir = highly concurrent service handling consumers efficiently

4️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer

“In our stack, AWS provides the infrastructure (EC2 or MSK), Kafka handles reliable event streaming, and Elixir processes act as highly concurrent producers and consumers. Elixir’s lightweight processes allow scaling consumers to process multiple Kafka partitions efficiently, making the system highly concurrent and fault-tolerant.”
