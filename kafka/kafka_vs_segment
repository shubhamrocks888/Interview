“Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that allows producers to write events to topics, which are consumed by services at their own pace. Segment.io is more like a customer data platform: it collects events and forwards them to analytics or marketing tools. Both handle events, but Kafka is designed for high-throughput, reliable messaging and real-time processing, while Segment.io is mostly for analytics pipelines.”
