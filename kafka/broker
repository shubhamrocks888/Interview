1️⃣ What is a Kafka Broker?

A broker is a Kafka server/node that stores and serves messages.

Each Kafka cluster has one or more brokers

Brokers manage topics, partitions, and consumer requests

Producers send events to brokers, consumers read events from brokers

2️⃣ Example with your scenario
Order Service (Producer)
        ↓
       Kafka Cluster
 ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
 │ Broker 0    │ │ Broker 1    │
 └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
        ↓
   orders topic with 2 partitions
Partition 0 → Broker 0 → order_id 1, 2, 5
Partition 1 → Broker 1 → order_id 3, 4, 6
        ↓
Consumers:
Email Service → reads from brokers
Analytics Service → reads from brokers


Each partition is hosted on a broker

Brokers store data, handle requests, and replicate partitions for fault tolerance

3️⃣ Key Roles of a Broker

1️⃣ Stores partitions

Each partition lives on a broker

Multiple brokers = partitions distributed across them

2️⃣ Handles client requests

Producers → send events

Consumers → read events

3️⃣ Replication & fault tolerance

Kafka can replicate partitions to multiple brokers

If one broker fails → another broker has a copy

4️⃣ Analogy (Simple)

Broker = post office branch

Producer = person sending letters

Consumer = person picking up letters

Multiple branches → handle more letters and survive branch failure

5️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer

“A Kafka broker is a server that stores partitions of topics, handles producer and consumer requests, and ensures replication for fault tolerance. In our orders example, different partitions of the orders topic can reside on different brokers, and consumers like Email or Analytics read events from these brokers independently.”

✅ Key takeaway

Broker = Kafka server

Partition = subset of topic stored on broker

Consumer/Producer interact with brokers

Multiple brokers = high throughput + fault tolerance
