Definition

Hashing converts data into a fixed-length value using a one-way function.

One-way → cannot be reversed

Same input → same output

Small change → completely different output

🔹 Example
password = "secret123"
hash(password) = "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"


You cannot get secret123 back from the hash.

🔹 Where hashing is used

Password storage

Data integrity checks

Digital signatures

🔹 Rails example (Devise)
has_secure_password


or in Devise:

Password is hashed (bcrypt)

Only hash is stored in DB

Login = hash(input password) + compare

2️⃣ Encryption
🔹 Definition

Encryption converts data into unreadable form that can be reversed using a key.

Two-way process

Requires a key

Can decrypt back to original data

🔹 Example
"credit_card" → encrypt(key) → "A9x#K!2"
"A9x#K!2" → decrypt(key) → "credit_card"

🔹 Where encryption is used

Credit card numbers

Tokens

Sensitive personal data

Secure communication (HTTPS)

3️⃣ Key Differences (Very Important)
Feature	Hashing	Encryption
Reversible	❌ No	✅ Yes
Key required	❌ No	✅ Yes
Purpose	Verify data	Protect data
Output length	Fixed	Variable
Password storage	✅ Correct	❌ Wrong
4️⃣ Why passwords are hashed, not encrypted

If passwords were encrypted:

Server could decrypt them

Data breach → passwords exposed

With hashing:

Server never knows the password

Only compares hashes

👉 This is critical for security

5️⃣ Salt & Pepper (Interview bonus)
🔹 Salt

Random value added to password before hashing

Prevents rainbow table attacks

hash(password + salt)


Devise uses bcrypt, which includes salt internally.

🔹 Pepper

Secret value stored in app config

Adds extra security

6️⃣ One-line Interview Answers
Hashing

Hashing is a one-way function used to verify data, commonly for password storage.

Encryption

Encryption is a reversible process used to protect sensitive data that must be read later.

7️⃣ Common Interview Trap

❌ “Passwords are encrypted in database”
✅ “Passwords are hashed in database”

Correcting this politely gives you extra points.

8️⃣ Real-world analogy

Hashing → fingerprint (can verify, cannot reconstruct)

Encryption → locked box (can unlock with key)

9️⃣ Final takeaway

Use hashing when you only need to verify

Use encryption when you need to retrieve

Passwords → always hashed

Sensitive data → encrypted
