1️⃣ PUT Request
🔹 Definition

PUT replaces the entire resource with the data you send.

“Here is the complete new version of this resource.”

🔹 Key Characteristics

Full update

Client must send all fields

Missing fields may be overwritten or set to null

Idempotent (calling it multiple times gives same result)

🔹 Example (REST API)

Existing User

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Shubham",
  "email": "shubham@gmail.com",
  "age": 25
}


PUT /users/1

{
  "name": "Shubham Jain",
  "email": "shubham.jain@gmail.com",
  "age": 26
}


✔️ Entire user replaced

⚠️ If you send:

{
  "name": "Shubham Jain"
}


Other fields (email, age) may be erased

🔹 Rails Example
put "/users/:id", to: "users#update"


Rails allows partial params, but conceptually PUT means full replace.

2️⃣ PATCH Request
🔹 Definition

PATCH updates only specific fields of a resource.

“Change only these fields.”

🔹 Key Characteristics

Partial update

Send only fields you want to change

Safer for small updates

Idempotent (in REST practice)

🔹 Example (REST API)

PATCH /users/1

{
  "email": "newemail@gmail.com"
}


✔️ Only email updated
✔️ Name & age remain unchanged

🔹 Rails Example
patch "/users/:id", to: "users#update"


Rails internally treats PATCH as the default for updates.

3️⃣ PUT vs PATCH – Side-by-Side
Aspect	PUT	PATCH
Purpose	Replace whole resource	Update part of resource
Data sent	Full object	Partial fields
Risk	Can overwrite data	Safer
Idempotent	Yes	Yes (usually)
Common usage	Rare	Very common
4️⃣ What Rails Uses (Important for Interview)
resources :users


Generates:

PATCH /users/:id  → users#update
PUT   /users/:id  → users#update


➡️ Rails prefers PATCH, but supports both.

5️⃣ Real-World Rule of Thumb

✔️ Use PATCH when:

Updating profile name

Changing password

Updating status, email, etc.

✔️ Use PUT when:

Replacing a full document

Strict REST APIs

Configuration objects

6️⃣ Interview One-Line Answer

PUT replaces the entire resource, while PATCH updates only specific fields. PATCH is safer and more commonly used in real applications like Rails.
