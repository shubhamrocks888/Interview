1. Abstraction
Definition (Simple)

Abstraction means hiding internal implementation and exposing only what is necessary.

Rails Example
User.create(name: "John", email: "john@test.com")


👉 You don’t know:

SQL queries

DB connections

Transactions

You only use a simple interface.

How to say in interview:

“Rails ActiveRecord abstracts database operations. I use User.create without worrying about SQL.”


### Ruby Example

class Order
  def place
    validate_order
    charge_payment
    send_confirmation
  end

  private

  def validate_order
    # validation logic
  end

  def charge_payment
    # payment logic
  end

  def send_confirmation
    # email logic
  end
end


2. Encapsulation
Definition (Simple)

Encapsulation means bundling data and methods together and restricting direct access.

Rails Example
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true

  private

  def normalize_email
    email.downcase
  end
end


Data (email) + behavior (normalize_email) are together

private hides internal logic

How to say:

“Rails models encapsulate business logic and protect internal methods using access modifiers.”


Ruby Example

class User
  attr_reader :email       # read-only
  attr_accessor :name      # read & write

  def initialize(name, email)
    @name = name
    self.email = email
  end

  def display_name
    name.upcase
  end

  private

  def email=(email)
    @email = email.downcase
  end
end



3. Inheritance
Definition (Simple)

Inheritance allows a class to reuse behavior from another class.

Rails Example
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
end

class UsersController < ApplicationController
end


👉 UsersController inherits:

Filters

Authentication

Common logic

How to say:

“Rails uses inheritance heavily, like controllers inheriting from ApplicationController.”






4. Polymorphism
Definition (Simple)

Polymorphism means same method name, different behavior.

Rails Example 1: ActiveRecord
User.find(1)
Post.find(1)


Same method find, different models.

Rails Example 2: Polymorphic Association
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
end


A comment can belong to:

Post

Photo

Article

How to say:

“Rails supports polymorphism using polymorphic associations and shared method names across models.”





#### Ruby example

class EmailNotification
  def send_message
    "Sending email"
  end
end

class SmsNotification
  def send_message
    "Sending SMS"
  end
end

def notify(notification)
  notification.send_message
end
