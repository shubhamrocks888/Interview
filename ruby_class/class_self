🎯 class << self — What Does It Mean?

It opens the singleton class (eigenclass) of the object.

Inside a class body:

class User
  class << self
  end
end


Here, self = User

So this means:

Open the singleton class of User

And that is where class methods live.

🧠 Simple Translation

This:

class << self
  def hello
    "Hi"
  end
end


Is exactly the same as:

def self.hello
  "Hi"
end


Both define class methods.

✅ Example
class User
  class << self
    def greet
      "Hello"
    end
  end
end

User.greet


Works perfectly.

💎 Why Do We Use It?

Because it allows grouping multiple class methods neatly.

Instead of:

class User
  def self.a; end
  def self.b; end
  def self.c; end
end


You can write:

class User
  class << self
    def a; end
    def b; end
    def c; end
  end
end


Cleaner and professional.

🔥 Real Power Example (Rails Style)
class User
  class << self
    attr_accessor :count
  end
end


This creates:

User.count

User.count=

These are class-level getters/setters.

🧠 What Is a Singleton Class?

Every object in Ruby has a hidden special class.

Example:

obj = "hello"

def obj.shout
  upcase
end


That method lives in obj’s singleton class.

Same concept.

🎯 Mental Model

| Syntax            | Meaning                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `def self.method` | Define one class method       |
| `class << self`   | Open class’s singleton class  |
| Inside it         | Define multiple class methods |


🚀 Interview-Level Answer

If asked:

What does class << self do?

You say:

It opens the singleton class of the current object, allowing us to define class-level methods.

That’s a strong answer.
