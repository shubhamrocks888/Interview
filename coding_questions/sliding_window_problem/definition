The sliding window technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving contiguous sequences in arrays or strings, often for sums, averages, maximum/minimum, or substrings. Instead of recalculating results for every possible subarray or substring (which is inefficient), it maintains a “window” of elements and slides it across the data, updating the result incrementally.

Here’s a breakdown:

🔹 How it works

Define a window:

Usually represented by two pointers: start (left) and end (right) that mark the current window in an array or string.

Compute something within the window:

For example: sum, count of unique characters, max value, etc.

Slide the window:

Move the end pointer forward to expand the window.

Move the start pointer forward to shrink the window (when conditions are no longer met).

Update your result:

Instead of recomputing from scratch for every window, update using previous computations.
