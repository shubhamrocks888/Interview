Problem: Valid Anagram

Question:

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An anagram means:

Both strings have the same characters

Each character occurs the same number of times

Order does not matter

Examples
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"
Output: true

s = "rat"
t = "car"
Output: false

s = ""
t = ""
Output: true

Key points

Strings must be of equal length. If not → return false

Count the frequency of each character

Compare counts → if all match → valid anagram

Approach 1: Sort and Compare

Sort both strings → check if equal

s.chars.sort == t.chars.sort


Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

✅ Simple, works in most interviews

Approach 2: Hash Map / Frequency Count (Optimal)

Count occurrences of each character in s

Count occurrences in t

Compare the two hashes

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

Ruby Code Using Hash
def valid_anagram(s, t)
  return false if s.length != t.length

  count = Hash.new(0)

  s.each_char { |char| count[char] += 1 }
  t.each_char { |char| count[char] -= 1 }

  count.values.all? { |v| v == 0 }
end

# Tests
p valid_anagram("anagram", "nagaram")  # => true
p valid_anagram("rat", "car")          # => false
p valid_anagram("", "")                 # => true

How it works

Count each char in s → add 1

Count each char in t → subtract 1

If all counts are zero → strings have same characters in same frequency → valid anagram

✅ Efficient, O(n) time, O(n) space

Interview explanation

“I count characters in the first string, then subtract counts using the second string. If all counts are zero, the strings are anagrams. This is O(n) time and O(n) space. Alternatively, sorting both strings works in O(n log n).”
