Reverse String — what the question is actually testing

On the surface, the question sounds trivial:

“Reverse a string.”

But interviewers do not care that you can reverse text.
They care how you think about space, mutation, and traversal.

Hidden constraints behind this question

Most interview versions quietly imply:

You are given a mutable sequence (array of characters, not an immutable string)

You should reverse it in place

You should use O(1) extra space

You should do it in O(n) time




def reverse_string(str)
    left = 0
    right = str.length-1
    
    while left < right
        str[left], str[right] = str[right], str[left]
        left+=1
        right-=1
    end
    str
end
