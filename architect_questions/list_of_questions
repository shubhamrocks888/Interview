🔥 Software Architect Interview Question Playbook
1️⃣ Rate Limiting & Traffic Control (VERY common)

Questions

3rd-party API allows 50 req/hr, traffic is 200/hr. What do you do?

Why not just queue everything?

Difference between token bucket and leaky bucket?

How do you prevent starvation?

They are testing

Backpressure

Queueing theory

Fairness vs throughput

Keywords to say

Leaky bucket, token bucket, bounded queues, backpressure, load shedding

2️⃣ High Traffic & System Stability

Questions

What happens if traffic keeps increasing forever?

How do you protect your system from overload?

How do you ensure old requests don’t starve?

They are testing

Capacity planning

Flow control

Stability under sustained load

Correct mindset

Unlimited input + limited output = reject or degrade

3️⃣ Async vs Sync (trap questions)

Questions

Why not make everything async?

Does async always scale?

Can async systems still fail?

They are testing

Understanding that async ≠ infinite capacity

Correct line

Async hides latency but doesn’t remove bottlenecks.

4️⃣ Security & Incident Response

Questions

Someone stole your payment gateway keys — what now?

API key leaked publicly — what’s first action?

How do you reduce blast radius?

They are testing

Incident response

Security maturity

Damage containment

Keywords

Credential rotation, IP whitelisting, least privilege, audit logs, alerts

5️⃣ Data Consistency & Concurrency

Questions

Two users transfer money at same time — what happens?

Can deadlocks occur?

How do you avoid double spending?

They are testing

Transactions

Locks

Idempotency

Keywords

DB transactions, optimistic locking, idempotency keys

6️⃣ Failure Handling & Resilience

Questions

What if Redis goes down?

What if Sidekiq is stuck?

What if 3rd-party API is slow or flaky?

They are testing

Fault tolerance

Graceful degradation

Keywords

Circuit breaker, retries, timeouts, fallbacks

7️⃣ Data Growth & Scaling

Questions

Table has 1 billion rows — how do you handle queries?

How do you archive old data?

How do you scale reads vs writes?

They are testing

Storage strategy

Long-term thinking

Keywords

Partitioning, sharding, read replicas, archiving

8️⃣ Observability & Monitoring

Questions

How do you know system is slow?

What metrics do you track?

How do you debug production issues?

They are testing

Operability

Keywords

Latency, throughput, error rate, queue depth, alerts

9️⃣ API Design & Contracts

Questions

How do you version APIs?

How do you handle breaking changes?

How do you make APIs backward compatible?

They are testing

Long-term maintainability

10️⃣ Business Trade-offs (VERY important)

Questions

Business says “don’t reject requests” — what now?

Latency vs cost — which do you choose?

Consistency vs availability?

They are testing

Decision-making

Not just technical correctness

Golden line

Architecture is about trade-offs, not perfection.

🎯 How to answer architect questions (RULE OF 3)

Always structure answers as:

Acknowledge the constraint

Explain the core principle

Give a practical solution

Example:

“Given a hard rate limit, we must apply backpressure. Practically, I’d use a bounded leaky bucket enforced at the ingress.”

🧠 One universal sentence that saves you

If you ever get stuck, say:

“At this point it becomes a system design and capacity problem, so we must bound the system or degrade gracefully.”

That sentence alone buys you time and respect.
