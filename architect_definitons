Short answer:

CPU-bound → slow because the CPU is busy thinking 🧠

I/O-bound → slow because the program is waiting on something else (disk, DB, network) ⏳

Now the clear breakdown 👇

What is CPU-bound?

A task is CPU-bound when its performance is limited by CPU computation speed.

👉 The program spends most of its time executing instructions, not waiting.

Characteristics

High CPU usage (80–100%)

Faster CPU = faster program

Threads don’t help much (unless multi-core + parallelizable)

Examples

Image/video processing

Encryption / hashing (bcrypt, SHA)

Data compression

Complex algorithms (sorting huge arrays, graph algorithms)

Machine learning training

# CPU-bound example
def fibonacci(n)
  return n if n <= 1
  fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
end


Here, CPU is constantly working → CPU-bound

What is I/O-bound?

A task is I/O-bound when its performance is limited by input/output operations.

👉 The program spends most of its time waiting.

What it waits for

Database

Disk

Network

External APIs

File system

Characteristics

Low CPU usage

Faster disk/network = faster program

Concurrency helps a LOT (threads, async, event loop)

Examples

DB queries

API calls

Reading/writing files

Uploading/downloading data

Rails controller actions (most of them!)

# I/O-bound example
user = User.find(1)     # DB call
sleep(2)                # simulates waiting


CPU is mostly idle → I/O-bound

Rails-specific intuition (important for interviews)
Most Rails apps are…

👉 I/O-bound, not CPU-bound

Why?

Waiting on DB

Waiting on Redis

Waiting on APIs

Waiting on S3

CPU-bound in Rails happens when

Heavy JSON processing

PDF generation

Image resizing

Encryption (bcrypt cost factor)

Large in-memory loops

How to identify which one you have?
Signs it’s CPU-bound

CPU at 100%

App slows even with no DB traffic

Adding more DB connections doesn’t help

Signs it’s I/O-bound

CPU is low

Threads are waiting

App speeds up with:

DB indexes

Caching

Faster network

Background jobs

Quick comparison

| Feature           | CPU-bound  | I/O-bound           |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Bottleneck        | CPU        | Disk / DB / Network |
| CPU usage         | High       | Low                 |
| Speed improves by | Faster CPU | Better I/O          |
| Threads help?     | ❌ little   | ✅ a lot             |
| Rails apps        | Rare       | Very common         |


One-liner you can say in interviews 💡

“A CPU-bound task is limited by computation speed, whereas an I/O-bound task is limited by waiting on external resources like databases or network calls.”
