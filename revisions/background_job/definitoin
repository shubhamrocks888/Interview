Active Job creates the job into ruby hash and pushes it to queue adapter


####

Sidekiq serializes to JSON

Sidekiq now:

Adds Sidekiq-specific metadata

Converts everything to JSON

Pushes it into Redis

####
Sidekiq pushes job to Redis

####

	what happens if something fails?
	Example: Email service down

	Sidekiq:

	Catches exception
	Retries job automatically
	Uses exponential backoff
	Stores retry info in Redis

	You get:

	Automatic retries
	Failure tracking
	Dead jobs queue

####

	Rails server / Sidekiq process crashes 🔥

	Important distinction:

	❌ Rails web server restart (Puma)
	✅ Sidekiq is a separate process

	But assuming Sidekiq itself crashes or is restarted:

	Job never gets acknowledged

	Sidekiq does NOT delete the job

	Redis still knows: this job was being worked on

4️⃣ How does Sidekiq interpret this command?
bundle exec sidekiq -q critical -q mailers -q default -q low

You can assign weights:
