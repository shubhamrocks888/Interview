🔐 Permissions Model (RBAC)
Core idea (say this first)

“We used role-based access control, where roles map to permissions, and permissions map to concrete actions in the system.”

That framing is important.

🧑‍💼 Role → What they can do
1️⃣ Admin (system owner)

Scope: Global

Typical permissions

Manage users (create, deactivate, assign roles)

Create / edit / delete courses

Create / edit / delete programs

Assign instructors & coordinators

View all enrollments and progress

Access all reports & analytics

Override enrollments or completions

System configuration

Interview-ready line

“Admins had unrestricted access and were responsible for system-wide configuration and governance.”

2️⃣ Coordinator (program-level supervisor)

Scope: Assigned programs / courses

Typical permissions

Create and manage programs (within scope)

Add/remove courses in programs

Control course ordering and rules

Enroll users into programs

View learner progress for assigned programs

Generate program-level reports

Communicate with instructors and learners

Important distinction

“Coordinators had operational control, but not system-level privileges.”

Architects love this clarity.

3️⃣ Instructor (content owner)

Scope: Assigned courses

Typical permissions

Create and update course content

Manage chapters and learning material

View enrollments for their courses

Track learner progress

Grade quizzes / assessments (if applicable)

Trigger course-level notifications

Key sentence

“Instructors owned content and learner outcomes, but couldn’t modify program structure or user roles.”

4️⃣ Learner (end user)

Scope: Self

Typical permissions

View enrolled courses and programs

Consume content

Track personal progress

Complete chapters / assessments

Download certificates (if eligible)

🧠 How permissions were enforced (VERY important)
Don’t just list permissions — explain enforcement.

“Permissions were enforced at the policy layer, ensuring that access checks were centralized and not scattered across controllers.”

If they ask deeper:

Policies checked:

Role

Ownership (assigned program / course)

Enrollment status

🔍 Likely follow-up questions
“Can one user have multiple roles?”

Strong answer:

“At the system level, a user had a primary role, but contextual permissions were applied via assignments—like an instructor being assigned to specific courses.”

(You avoided over-complicating with multi-role users 👍)

“How do you prevent privilege escalation?”

Answer:

“Role assignment was restricted to admins, and all sensitive actions were guarded by explicit permission checks.”

“How did you handle future role additions?”

Answer:

“Because permissions were decoupled from roles, adding a new role was mainly a configuration change.”

⚠️ Common mistakes to avoid

❌ hardcoding role checks (if role == admin)

❌ permissions scattered in controllers

❌ no ownership validation

🧠 30-second executive summary

“We implemented RBAC where roles map to permissions and permissions map to actions.
Admins handled system-level control, coordinators managed program operations, and instructors focused on content and learners.
Authorization was centralized via policies to keep it secure and maintainable.”
