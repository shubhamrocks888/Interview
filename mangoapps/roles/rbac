🔐 What is RBAC?

RBAC = Role-Based Access Control

“RBAC is an authorization model where access is granted based on roles, not on individual users.
Each role has a predefined set of permissions, and users inherit permissions through their assigned role.”

That’s the clean definition.

🧱 Core idea (very important)
User → Role → Permissions → Actions


Users never get direct access to actions.
They get a role, and the role decides what they can do.

🧑‍💼 Why Admin can access everything
How it works logically

Admin role is assigned all permissions

Policies check:

If user has permission → allow

Else → deny

So:

Admin passes every permission check

Coordinators & instructors only pass scoped checks

🧠 Interview-ready explanation (say this)

“Admins don’t bypass authorization logic.
They simply have all permissions assigned to their role, so they naturally pass every permission check.”

That sentence is 🔥

🧱 Example permissions
permissions
manage_users
manage_courses
manage_programs
enroll_users
view_all_reports
update_course_content
view_course_progress

Role → Permission mapping
Role	Permissions
Admin	All permissions
Coordinator	manage_programs, enroll_users, view_program_reports
Instructor	update_course_content, view_course_progress
🔍 How coordinators & instructors are restricted
1️⃣ Permission-level restriction

They don’t have system-level permissions like:

manage_users

assign_roles

2️⃣ Scope-level restriction (VERY important)

Even if they have a permission, it’s scoped.

Example:

Instructor can update_course_content

BUT only for courses they’re assigned to

Say this:

“Permissions were always evaluated together with ownership or assignment checks.”

Architects expect this.

🧠 How authorization is enforced (implementation level)
Centralized policies

Instead of:

if user.role == 'admin'


We do:

authorize :course, :update?


And inside policy:

Check permission

Check ownership

This keeps logic:

Centralized

Testable

Secure

🔍 Follow-up they might ask
“How do you prevent privilege escalation?”

Answer:

“Only admins can assign roles or permissions, and all such actions are audited.”

“Why not just check role in controller?”

Answer:

“Hardcoded role checks don’t scale. RBAC keeps authorization declarative and avoids duplication.”

🧠 20-second summary (perfect closing)

“RBAC works by assigning permissions to roles and roles to users.
Admins can access everything because their role has all permissions, not because they bypass checks.
Coordinators and instructors are restricted both by permission set and by ownership scope, with authorization enforced centrally via policies.”
