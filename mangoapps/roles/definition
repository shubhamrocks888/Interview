✅ Correct, scalable design
Roles should be a separate table

users should reference role_id, not store role names directly.

🧱 Revised tables
roles
id
name        # admin, instructor, coordinator, learner
description
created_at
updated_at

users
id
name
email
role_id
status
created_at
updated_at

🧠 Why this is the right design (say this)

“We kept roles normalized in a separate table so authorization logic wasn’t tightly coupled to user records and could evolve without schema changes.”

That line alone sounds architect-level.

🔍 Follow-up they may ask
“Why not just use enum in users?”

Answer:

“Enums are fine for very small, static systems.
We wanted flexibility to add or modify roles, attach metadata, and manage permissions without redeploying code or running risky migrations.”

🔐 Taking it one step more mature (RBAC)

If they push further 👇

permissions
id
name

role_permissions
role_id
permission_id


Now authorization becomes:

Role → Permissions

User → Role

“This allowed us to manage access centrally and keep authorization logic declarative.”

🔥 Very strong answer.

⚠️ When role column IS acceptable (optional honesty)

You can also say:

“For early versions or very small systems, a role enum can be acceptable, but for an LMS with multiple supervisors and evolving permissions, a separate roles table scales better.”

Balanced, practical answer.

🧠 15-second summary

“Users reference roles via role_id. Roles are normalized so permissions and behavior can evolve without coupling business logic to user records.”
