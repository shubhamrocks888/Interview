🚫 Problem: User drags seek bar to the end

If we naïvely trust:

player.currentTime


User can:

Drag to 99%

Send heartbeat

Mark video completed

❌ Not acceptable for LMS.

✅ Correct mindset (say this first)

“We never trust absolute seek position.
We track continuous playback on the backend.”

🟢 Solution 1: Track progressive time, not jumps (MOST IMPORTANT)
Backend logic
MAX_INCREMENT = 15 # seconds per heartbeat

delta = current_time - progress.last_watched_second

if delta > 0 && delta <= MAX_INCREMENT
  progress.last_watched_second = current_time
end


What this does:

Allows natural forward playback

Rejects large jumps

Seek to end ≠ progress

Interview line:

“Progress only advances within expected playback bounds.”

🟢 Solution 2: Use player events (frontend assist)

Frontend listens to:

play

pause

seeking

seeked

If seeking detected:

Temporarily pause progress updates

Resume only after continuous playback

This helps but backend still enforces rules.

🟢 Solution 3: Minimum watch time rule

Example:

Must watch ≥ 90% duration
AND
Must watch continuously ≥ X seconds


So even if they jump:

They still need actual playback time

🟢 Solution 4: Segment-level validation (advanced)

Because HLS plays small .ts segments:

Backend can track segment sequence numbers

Only count segments fetched in order

This is advanced but very strong.

Interview phrasing:

“We can validate playback continuity at segment level for high-trust environments.”

🟢 Solution 5: Cap progress per heartbeat

Even if frontend lies:

progress.last_watched_second += HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL


Instead of trusting currentTime.

This makes cheating mathematically impossible.

🧠 What NOT to say

❌ “We disable seek bar”
(Users hate it, accessibility issues)

❌ “Frontend handles it”
(Frontend is untrusted)

🧠 One-paragraph interview answer (memorize)

“To prevent users from skipping videos, we don’t trust absolute seek positions.
We track progressive playback using heartbeat updates and only allow progress to advance within expected bounds.
Large jumps are ignored, and completion is determined by continuous watch time rather than final position.”
