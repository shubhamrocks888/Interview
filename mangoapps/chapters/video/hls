1️⃣ What is HLS (in plain English)

HLS = HTTP Live Streaming

It’s a way of delivering video as many small files instead of one big file.

Instead of:

video.mp4  (1.5 GB)


You get:

index.m3u8
segment_001.ts
segment_002.ts
segment_003.ts
...

2️⃣ What files make up HLS?
a) .m3u8 — the playlist (the brain)

This is a text file, not video.

Example (simplified):

#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=800000
360p/index.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=2500000
720p/index.m3u8


What it does:

Tells the player what qualities exist

Tells where the segments are

Controls playback order

Think of it as:

“Table of contents for the video”

b) .ts files — the actual video chunks

Each .ts file is ~2–10 seconds of video

Player downloads them one by one

Example:

segment_001.ts
segment_002.ts
segment_003.ts


Why chunks?

Faster start

Resume after network failure

Cache-friendly

3️⃣ How playback works (step-by-step)

Player requests master.m3u8

Player chooses best quality based on network

Player downloads small .ts segments

If network slows → switches quality automatically

User never notices.

4️⃣ Why not just MP4?

Architect reasons:

MP4	HLS
Single large file	Small chunks
No adaptive bitrate	Adaptive bitrate
Hard to resume	Easy resume
Poor CDN caching	Excellent CDN caching

Interview line:

“HLS enables adaptive streaming, fault tolerance, and efficient CDN caching.”

5️⃣ Why HLS is perfect for LMS

Students pause & resume often

Network conditions vary

Mobile + desktop users

Progress tracking needs accuracy

6️⃣ Where HLS lives in our system

Generated by backend worker

Stored in S3

Served via CDN

Played by browser player

Rails only stores:

Path to .m3u8

Duration

7️⃣ One-sentence interview answer (memorize)

“HLS is a streaming format where videos are broken into small segments and controlled by playlist files, allowing adaptive quality, fast startup, and reliable playback over HTTP.”
