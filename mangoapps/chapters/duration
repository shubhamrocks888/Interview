⏱️ What is the duration column used for?

duration represents the expected time (or actual time) required to complete a piece of content
(video, chapter, quiz, reading, etc.).

✅ Primary uses (these are interview-worthy)
1️⃣ Accurate progress calculation (VERY important)

Instead of:

each chapter = equal weight ❌

You can do:

progress based on time weight ✅

Example
Chapter	Duration
Video 1	10 min
Video 2	30 min

If user completes Video 1:

Progress = 10 / 40 = 25%


Say this line:

“Duration allows us to calculate weighted progress instead of naive chapter counts.”

Architects love this.

2️⃣ Learning analytics & reporting

“Total learning time per user”

“Time spent per course”

“Drop-off points”

“Duration enables meaningful learning analytics beyond just completion flags.”

3️⃣ UX & expectations

Used in UI:

“This course takes ~3 hours”

“Chapter: 15 mins”

This improves user trust and engagement.

4️⃣ Program-level planning

At program level:

Total program duration

Mandatory time thresholds

Certifications requiring X hours

🔁 Expected vs actual duration

Architect follow-up:
“Is this expected or actual duration?”

Best answer:

“We stored expected duration on content, and optionally tracked actual time spent separately per user.”

Example (advanced, optional)
user_content_time
  user_id
  content_id
  time_spent

⚠️ Common mistake

❌ using duration as completion signal
Completion should come from progress logic, not just time.

“Duration is used for weighted progress calculation, analytics, and setting learner expectations. It allows us to move beyond simple completion counts.”
