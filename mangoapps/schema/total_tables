🧠 How to say this in interview (important)

Don’t dump everything at once. Say:

“At a high level, we had core entities like users, courses, programs, and chapters.
Relationships and state lived in enrollment and join tables, while progress was tracked at chapter, course, and program levels for performance and analytics.”

That framing matters more than raw tables.

🏁 20-second executive summary

“The schema separates content structure from user state.
Static entities like courses and chapters are independent, while dynamic state—enrollment and progress—is modeled explicitly, making the system scalable and flexible.”
