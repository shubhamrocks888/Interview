Good question — this phrase sounds fancy in interviews, but it actually means something very practical 🙂

When someone says:

“a modular monolith with clearly separated domains—users, courses, programs, and enrollments”

“Clearly separated domains” means:

Each business domain is treated like its own mini-application inside the same codebase, with strong boundaries.

1️⃣ What is a “domain” here?

A domain = a business area with its own rules and logic

Examples in your case:

Users domain → users, roles, authentication, profiles

Courses domain → courses, lessons, syllabus

Programs domain → bundles of courses, pricing, duration

Enrollments domain → who enrolled in what, progress, status

Each domain answers one type of business question.

2️⃣ “Clearly separated” in practical terms 👇
✅ Separate folders / modules
app/
  domains/
    users/
      user.rb
      user_service.rb
      user_repository.rb
    courses/
      course.rb
      course_service.rb
    programs/
      program.rb
    enrollments/
      enrollment.rb


Not everything dumped into models/ or services/.

✅ Domain owns its logic

User-related rules live only in users

Course rules live only in courses

Enrollment logic is not spread everywhere

❌ Bad:

User.enroll(course)


✅ Good:

Enrollments::EnrollUser.call(user, course)

✅ Minimal cross-domain access

Domains don’t reach into each other’s internals.

❌ Bad:

Course.find(id).users.create(...)


✅ Good:

Enrollments::Create.call(user_id:, course_id:)


Domains communicate via interfaces / services, not direct DB poking.

✅ Separate tables (often)
users
courses
programs
enrollments


enrollments acts as a boundary domain

No giant tables doing everything

3️⃣ Why interviewers love this answer ❤️

Because it shows you understand:

Separation of concerns

Scalability without microservices

Clean architecture

Easier refactoring later

You can even say:

“Each domain could later be extracted into a microservice if needed.”

That’s a 🔥 bonus line.

4️⃣ One-line interview explanation (memorize this)

“Clearly separated domains mean each business area has its own models, services, and rules, with strong boundaries and minimal coupling—even though everything lives in a single monolith.”
