1️⃣ “Explain the system” (they almost always start here)

Expected questions

Can you walk us through the LMS architecture?

What were the core entities and how did they relate?

What was the scale? (users, courses, enrollments)

What was your role specifically?

What they’re really checking

Can you explain a system clearly and logically

Do you understand domain modeling

Are you owning your work or just part of a team

Be ready to talk about

Users, Courses, Programs, Enrollments

Role-based access (admin / instructor / coordinator / learner)

High-level architecture (monolith vs services)

Where business logic lived

2️⃣ Data modeling & relationships (VERY likely)

Since you mention enrollments 👀

Expected questions

Why did you use an enrollment table?

Difference between course enrollment and program enrollment?

How did you handle many-to-many relationships?

How did you track progress or completion?

Follow-ups

What indexes did you add and why?

How did you avoid duplicate enrollments?

How did you handle soft deletes or historical data?

What they’re testing

Database design maturity

Tradeoffs, not textbook answers

3️⃣ Roles, permissions & authorization

Architects love this.

Expected questions

How did you manage roles and permissions?

Was it RBAC or something custom?

How did you ensure instructors could only see their courses?

How did coordinators differ from admins?

Good follow-ups

Did you use policy objects?

How did you avoid permission logic scattered across code?

What they’re testing

Security mindset

Clean separation of concerns

4️⃣ Scalability & performance questions

Director of Eng will almost certainly go here.

Expected questions

What happens if enrollments grow 10x?

How did you handle heavy read vs write traffic?

Any performance issues you faced?

How did you optimize course listing or dashboards?

Follow-ups

Pagination strategies?

Caching (Redis / fragment caching)?

Background jobs for heavy tasks?

What they’re testing

Can you think beyond “it works”

Awareness of real production problems

5️⃣ Consistency, concurrency & edge cases

Since LMS has state changes.

Expected questions

What if two admins enroll the same user at the same time?

How did you handle concurrent updates?

What happens if a job fails mid-way?

They may push

Did you use DB constraints?

Transactions?

Idempotent jobs?

6️⃣ Business rules & workflows

Very common at Director level.

Expected questions

Who defines completion criteria?

Can a course belong to multiple programs?

What happens if a course is removed from a program?

Can users be unenrolled? What about progress?

What they’re testing

Ability to convert business rules → code

Not just “Rails knowledge”

7️⃣ Observability & reliability

Often overlooked by candidates.

Expected questions

How did you monitor failures?

How did you debug production issues?

Any alerting or logging setup?

Bonus points

Error tracking tools

Audit logs for enrollment changes

8️⃣ Trade-offs & “why” questions (MOST IMPORTANT)

They’ll probe your decisions.

Expected questions

Why this design and not another?

What would you change if you rebuilt it?

Biggest technical debt?

Any decision you disagreed with?

This is where seniors shine

Admit imperfections

Explain constraints (time, team, business)

9️⃣ Your ownership & impact

Director of Eng will ask this explicitly or implicitly.

Expected questions

What part did you own end-to-end?

Did you mentor anyone?

Did you influence design decisions?

How did you handle disagreements?

🔟 Architecture-level hypothetical

Especially from Software Architect.

Examples

If we add certifications on top of courses, how would you model it?

If we want multi-tenant LMS, what changes?

How would you expose this via APIs for mobile apps?

How to prepare (practical advice)

Instead of memorizing:

Draw ER diagram in your head

Prepare 1 scaling story

Prepare 1 production issue you solved

Prepare 1 decision you’d redo differently

Golden tip for introduction 💡

End your intro with:

“I worked closely on data modeling, enrollment workflows, and role-based access, and also handled performance and scaling challenges as usage grew.”

That invites the right questions and makes you look senior.
