❓ Where do we store course_id → program relationship?
✅ Correct design

NOT in courses table.

You store it in a join table:

program_courses

📦 Tables involved
programs
  id
  name

courses
  id
  title

program_courses
  id
  program_id
  course_id
  position / order (optional)
  mandatory (optional)

🧠 Why not program_id in courses?

Because:

1️⃣ One course can belong to multiple programs

If you put program_id in courses, you force:

❌ 1 course → 1 program (wrong)

❌ duplication of courses

2️⃣ Programs are compositions, not ownership

A program is a collection of courses, not the owner of the course.

This line sounds very architect-level 👇

“Programs compose courses; they don’t own them.”

3️⃣ You often need metadata on the relationship

Examples:

Order of course in program

Mandatory vs optional course

Unlock rules (course B after course A)

That data belongs to the relationship, not to course or program.

🎯 Interview-ready answer (say this)

“Courses and programs had a many-to-many relationship, so we modeled it using a join table like program_courses.
This allowed a course to be reused across multiple programs and also gave us flexibility to store program-specific metadata like course order or mandatory flags.”

This is a perfect answer.

🔍 Follow-up they may ask
“Why not just infer program completion from course enrollments?”

Answer:

“Program completion has its own rules—like mandatory courses or minimum completion criteria—so program enrollment and progress were tracked independently from individual course enrollments.”

“What happens if a course is removed from a program?”

Answer:

“Existing enrollments were preserved for audit and progress consistency, while new enrollments reflected the updated structure.”

💡 That shows maturity.

🧠 Quick mental model (important)
Relationship	Table
User ↔ Course	course_enrollments
User ↔ Program	program_enrollments
Program ↔ Course	program_courses

If you say this table clearly in an interview, architects relax 😄
