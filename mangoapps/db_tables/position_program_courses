Program P1 contains courses C1 → C2 → C3 in a specific order.

✅ How it is stored (clean & correct)
program_courses table
id	program_id	course_id	position	mandatory
1	P1	C1	1	true
2	P1	C2	2	true
3	P1	C3	3	false
🧠 Key points (say this in interview)

“We stored the order of courses inside the program_courses join table using a position column, which allowed each program to define its own sequence independently.”

This line is gold 🥇

❓ Why position in join table?
1️⃣ Same course, different order in different programs

Program P1: C1 → C2 → C3

Program P2: C2 → C3 → C1

This is impossible if order lives in courses.

2️⃣ Program-specific rules

You can add:

mandatory

unlock_after_course_id

min_score

weightage

All belong to program ↔ course, not course itself.

🔍 Likely follow-up questions
“How do you fetch courses in order?”

Answer:

“We query program_courses ordered by position, joining courses to fetch details.”

Simple and confident.

“What if order changes?”

Answer:

“We update the position values inside a transaction to avoid inconsistent ordering.”

Mention transaction → big plus.

“What about gaps in position (1, 10, 20)?”

Answer (optional, senior touch):

“We sometimes left gaps to allow reordering without mass updates, and normalized positions periodically.”

Architects love this 😄

⚠️ Common mistakes (don’t say these)

❌ store array of course_ids in programs

❌ store order in courses table

❌ hardcode logic in application

🧠 15-second summary

“Program-course ordering was handled via a join table with a position column, allowing flexible sequencing and program-specific rules without duplicating course data.”
