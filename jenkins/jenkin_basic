1️⃣ What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is a CI/CD tool used to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines.

CI = Continuous Integration
CD = Continuous Delivery / Deployment


2️⃣ Why Jenkins is used

Without Jenkins:

Manual builds

Manual testing

Manual deployments

Human errors

With Jenkins:

Automated pipeline

Faster feedback

Safer releases

3️⃣ What Jenkins actually does (Simple Flow)
	Developer pushes code →
	Jenkins triggers →
	Build →
	Run tests →
	Create artifact / Docker image →
	Deploy


4️⃣ Jenkins in YOUR JD Context (Docker + AWS)
	Typical setup:
	GitHub →
	Jenkins →
	Docker →
	ECR →
	EC2 / ECS

Step-by-step:

	1️⃣ Code pushed to GitHub
	2️⃣ Jenkins job triggered (webhook)
	3️⃣ Jenkins:

	Runs tests (RSpec / ExUnit)

	Builds Docker image
	4️⃣ Pushes image to AWS ECR
	5️⃣ Deploys container to EC2 or ECS



5️⃣ What is a Jenkins Pipeline?

	A pipeline is a set of steps defined as code.

	Usually written in Jenkinsfile.

	Example (conceptual):

	Build → Test → Docker Build → Deploy


6️⃣ Key Jenkins Concepts (Very Important)

		| Term     | Meaning                        |
		| -------- | ------------------------------ |
		| Job      | A task Jenkins runs            |
		| Pipeline | CI/CD steps as code            |
		| Agent    | Machine that runs the job      |
		| Plugin   | Extends Jenkins features       |
		| Webhook  | Triggers Jenkins automatically |

7️⃣ Jenkins vs Manual Deployment (Interview Angle)

		Manual	Jenkins
		Error-prone	Automated
		Slow	Fast
		Not repeatable	Consistent
		No rollback	Easy rollback


8️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer (Memorize)

	“Jenkins is a CI/CD automation tool that helps us build, test, and deploy applications automatically. In our setup, Jenkins builds Docker images, runs tests, pushes images to ECR, and deploys them to EC2 or ECS.”
