Great question — this is pure backend + DevOps, and interviewers love when candidates can explain it end-to-end, not just “Jenkins runs a pipeline”.

I’ll explain:

What actually happens

Where the webhook lives

Whether Rails is involved

How you would do it in a Rails app

Interview-ready answer

1️⃣ What does “Jenkins triggered via webhook” really mean?

It means:

Some external system sends an HTTP request to Jenkins to start a job.

Most commonly:

GitHub

GitLab

Bitbucket

Not Rails (usually).

2️⃣ Typical real flow (most common)
Developer pushes code
        |
        v
GitHub/GitLab
        |
        |  (Webhook HTTP POST)
        v
Jenkins
        |
        v
Build → Test → Docker → Deploy


So yes:

Totally backend

No UI

Just HTTP

3️⃣ Where is the webhook configured?
On GitHub / GitLab side

You configure:

URL: https://jenkins.example.com/github-webhook/

Event: push / pull_request

Secret (HMAC)

GitHub sends JSON payload like:

{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "after": "commit_hash",
  "repository": {...}
}

4️⃣ What does Jenkins do with that webhook?

In Jenkins:

Job is configured as “GitHub webhook trigger”

Jenkins verifies signature

Jenkins pulls code

Jenkins runs pipeline

Example Jenkinsfile:

pipeline {
  stages {
    stage('Test') {
      steps { sh 'bundle exec rspec' }
    }
    stage('Build Docker') {
      steps { sh 'docker build -t app .' }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps { sh 'ecs deploy ...' }
    }
  }
}

5️⃣ Is Rails involved at all?
❌ Normally: NO

Rails:

Is the application being built

Not the trigger

Jenkins reacts to:

Git events, not app events

6️⃣ When would Rails trigger Jenkins? (edge case)

Rails might trigger Jenkins if:

You want manual deployments

Or internal admin workflow

Example:

Admin clicks “Deploy”
Rails → Jenkins API

7️⃣ How Rails triggers Jenkins (if needed)

Rails sends HTTP request:

require "net/http"

uri = URI("https://jenkins.example.com/job/deploy/build")
req = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri)
req.basic_auth("jenkins_user", "api_token")

Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
  http.request(req)
end


But again:
👉 This is rare in modern CI/CD

8️⃣ Where Jenkins fits in your Rails + Elixir + Kafka system
Git Push
   |
   v
GitHub Webhook
   |
   v
Jenkins
   |
   +-- Build Rails Docker image
   +-- Build Elixir Docker image
   +-- Run tests
   +-- Push to ECR
   +-- Deploy to ECS


Jenkins does infrastructure automation, not business logic.

9️⃣ Interview-ready answer (very strong)

Say this:

“Jenkins is typically triggered via webhooks from the Git provider like GitHub. This is a backend HTTP callback that Jenkins listens to. Rails is not involved in triggering Jenkins; Rails is the artifact being built and deployed.”

If they push:

“Rails could call Jenkins via API, but that’s uncommon in standard CI/CD setups.”
