1️⃣ What is CI/CD?
CI — Continuous Integration

Automatically build and test code whenever developers push changes.

Why?

Catch bugs early

Avoid broken main branch

Example

Code pushed → Tests run automatically


CD — Continuous Delivery / Deployment

Continuous Delivery → code is always deployable

Continuous Deployment → code is automatically deployed to production

Example

Tests pass → App deployed automatically

Interview One-liner

“CI/CD automates building, testing, and deploying software so changes reach users faster and more reliably.”



What is Jenkinsfile?

A Jenkinsfile defines the CI/CD pipeline as code.

Stored in repo

Written in Groovy

Version controlled

Why important?

Reproducible

Reviewable

Same pipeline for everyone

Simple Example (conceptual)
Build → Test → Docker → Deploy

Interview One-liner

“Jenkinsfile defines pipeline stages and steps as code.”

4️⃣ How Jenkins works with Docker
		Why Docker + Jenkins?

		Clean build environment

		No dependency conflicts

		Same environment every run

		Typical flow

		1️⃣ Jenkins pulls code
		2️⃣ Runs tests inside Docker
		3️⃣ Builds Docker image
		4️⃣ Tags image
		5️⃣ Pushes image to registry (ECR)

		Jenkins → Docker build → Docker image

		Interview One-liner

		“Jenkins uses Docker to build consistent, isolated images and run tests reliably.”

5️⃣ How Jenkins deploys to AWS

		Common deployment methods
		🔹 EC2

		Jenkins SSHs into EC2

		Pulls Docker image

		Restarts container

		🔹 ECS

		Jenkins updates ECS task definition

		ECS deploys new containers

		🔹 EKS

		Jenkins updates Kubernetes manifests

		Typical AWS Flow (Most likely)
		GitHub →
		Jenkins →
		Docker →
		ECR →
		EC2 / ECS

		Interview One-liner

		“Jenkins deploys to AWS by building Docker images, pushing them to ECR, and updating EC2 or ECS to run the new image.”

🔥 Final Interview Summary (Say this confidently)

	“CI/CD automates integration and deployment. Jenkins uses pipelines defined in Jenkinsfiles to build, test, and deploy applications. It works well with Docker by building container images and integrates with AWS by pushing images to ECR and deploying them to EC2 or ECS.”
