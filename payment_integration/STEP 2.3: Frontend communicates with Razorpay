STEP 2.3: Frontend communicates with Razorpay
Which API is called?

Razorpay Checkout JS (rzp.open()) handles it automatically.

The frontend itself calls Razorpay’s “Payments API” internally, you don’t have to call it manually.

Behind the scenes, the Checkout calls:

POST https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments


with:

order_id (from backend)

amount

currency

Payment details entered by user (card/UPI info)

Other metadata like name, email, etc.

All of this happens inside Razorpay’s secure popup — PCI compliance is handled by them.

What is the response from Razorpay at this stage?

Once the user successfully completes payment, Razorpay sends back to the frontend:

{
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_ABC123",
  "razorpay_order_id": "order_Lk8XwP9abc123",
  "razorpay_signature": "abcdef1234567890"
}


razorpay_payment_id → unique ID for this payment

razorpay_order_id → same as the order you created in step 1

razorpay_signature → HMAC SHA256 hash to verify payment authenticity

Key points:

Frontend never touches secret key — safe for PCI compliance

Payment_id is generated by Razorpay only after successful transaction

Frontend now has enough info to tell your backend: “Payment attempt completed, please verify.”

DB at this point

Nothing changes yet. Still:

id	razorpay_order_id	razorpay_payment_id	amount	status
1	order_Lk8XwP9abc123	NULL	50000	created

Payment_id is only saved after backend verification (Step 3)

✅ Interview-ready explanation for this step

Step 2 involves Razorpay Checkout JS sending user’s payment details securely to Razorpay’s Payments API.
Razorpay processes the payment with the bank and returns payment_id and signature to the frontend.
At this point, our backend still only knows that an order exists, but payment success is not yet confirmed.
