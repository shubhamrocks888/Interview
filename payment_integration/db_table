If you want to keep it minimal, you can get away with just one table — usually called orders — that tracks everything related to payments and refunds.

Here’s how it can look:

Table: orders
Column	Type	Description
id	bigint / pk	Rails primary key
user_id	bigint	The customer who placed the order
amount	integer	Order amount in paise
razorpay_order_id	string	Order ID returned by Razorpay
razorpay_payment_id	string	Payment ID returned by Razorpay (if payment attempted)
status	string	created / paid / failed / refunded
refunded_amount	integer	Amount refunded, if any
currency	string	Default INR
created_at / updated_at	datetime	Rails timestamps
Notes:

Single table can handle everything:

Order creation (created)

Payment success (paid)

Payment failed (failed)

Refund (refunded, with refunded_amount column)

Partial refunds:

You can still use one table:

refunded_amount tracks how much has been refunded

status = refunded when full refund, or status = partially_refunded if partial

Foreign keys:

user_id → link to your users table

Optional: Separate refunds table

Only needed if you want multiple partial refunds per order

Minimal approach: single orders table is enough

💡 Interview-ready line:

You can manage Razorpay integration with a single orders table that stores order_id, payment_id, status, and refunded amount. This is sufficient for normal payments, failed payments, and partial or full refunds.
