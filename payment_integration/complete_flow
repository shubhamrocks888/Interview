Normal Flow: User completes payment normally

	User clicks “Pay ₹500” → backend creates order → frontend gets order_id

	Razorpay Checkout opens → user enters payment info → payment succeeds

	Razorpay returns payment_id + signature to frontend

	Frontend immediately calls backend /verify API

	Backend verifies signature → updates DB → status = paid

	Webhook is optional here — it may still trigger later, but your backend has already recorded payment.

Edge Case: User closes browser mid-payment or network fails

	Backend created order → frontend opened Razorpay Checkout → user pays

	Browser is closed or frontend never calls /verify

	Frontend does nothing

	Razorpay still processes payment → triggers webhook

	Backend receives webhook → verifies signature → updates DB → status = paid

	Webhook acts as a “safety net” ensuring your DB is consistent.

Key points / Interview-ready lines

	Frontend verification: fast, immediate, improves UX

	Webhooks: reliable, guarantees payment status even if frontend fails

	Backend DB always updated by either step 3 or step 4

	💡 Interview line you can say:

	“Frontend verification handles normal flow for immediate response, and webhooks handle edge cases where the user abandons the payment. Both use signature verification to ensure authenticity.”

Optional note:

	Even in normal flow, webhook may still arrive later.

	Some companies ignore it if payment is already verified

	Others reconcile it to ensure data integrity
