STEP 1️⃣
Backend calls Razorpay Create Order API

Your code:

order = Razorpay::Order.create(
  amount: 50000,
  currency: 'INR'
)

What Razorpay returns (ACTUAL RESPONSE)

Razorpay responds with a JSON object like this 👇

{
  "id": "order_Lk8XwP9abc123",
  "entity": "order",
  "amount": 50000,
  "amount_paid": 0,
  "amount_due": 50000,
  "currency": "INR",
  "receipt": null,
  "status": "created",
  "attempts": 0,
  "created_at": 1700000000
}


👉 Important fields right now

id → Razorpay order id

status → "created"

amount_paid → 0

💡 No payment has happened yet.

What backend should do NEXT (still STEP 1)
✅ Save order in YOUR database

At this moment:

You ONLY know that an order is created

You DO NOT know payment_id

You DO NOT know success / failure

So you save minimal information.

DB insert 👇
Order.create!(
  razorpay_order_id: order.id,
  amount: order.amount,
  status: 'created'
)

Your DB after STEP 1
id	razorpay_order_id	razorpay_payment_id	amount	status
1	order_Lk8XwP9abc123	NULL	50000	created

📌 razorpay_payment_id is NULL
📌 status is created

What backend returns to frontend
{
  "order_id": "order_Lk8XwP9abc123",
  "key": "rzp_test_xxxxx"
}


👉 This is used by Razorpay Checkout

Interview-grade explanation (STEP 1)

At this stage, we only create an order on Razorpay and store the Razorpay order ID in our database with status created. No payment has occurred yet.

❗ VERY IMPORTANT (Don’t skip this)
❓ Why do we save order before payment?

Because:

User may abandon payment

Payment may fail

Browser may crash

We still need:

A record of intent

A reference to reconcile later via webhooks

STOP HERE ✋

We have completed STEP 1 only.

If you’re clear, say “Next step”
Then we’ll go to STEP 2: Razorpay Checkout + payment attempt
