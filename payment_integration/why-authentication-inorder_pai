Why is this authentication needed? (2 core reasons)
1️⃣ Identify WHO is creating the order (Merchant identity)

✔ Razorpay must know:

Which merchant account this order belongs to

Which dashboard it should appear in

Which settlement bank account will receive money

So yes ✅
👉 It identifies the customer (merchant), NOT the end user

📌 Interview line:

The key_id identifies the merchant account.

2️⃣ Security – prevent unauthorized order creation

Only someone who has:

key_id

secret

can:

Create orders

Fetch payments

Verify signatures

Process refunds

❌ Without secret → request rejected

📌 Interview line:

The secret key ensures only authorized servers can create orders.

Very Important Clarification (Interview Trap ❗)
❌ It does NOT identify the end user who clicked Pay

Razorpay does not know:

which user

which email

which customer in your DB

👉 Razorpay only knows merchant

The user–order mapping is YOUR responsibility.

Example:

Order.create(
  user_id: current_user.id,
  razorpay_order_id: order.id,
  amount: 50000
)

One-Line Interview Answer (MEMORIZE)

Razorpay authentication using key_id and secret is used to authenticate the merchant’s server and securely associate the order with the correct Razorpay merchant account.

Simple Mental Model 🧠
User clicks Pay
   ↓
Your server says to Razorpay:
"I am Shubham’s Rails app, here is my secret"
   ↓
Razorpay says:
"Okay, you are verified. Order created."

Bonus Interview Question
❓ Why not put secret key in frontend?

👉 Anyone can:

Create fake orders

Issue refunds

Access payments

📌 Final punch line:

Secret key must always stay on server.
