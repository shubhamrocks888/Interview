Webhook — Simplified Definition

A webhook is a design pattern where a server sends or receives HTTP requests automatically whenever a specific event occurs.

Key points:

Event-driven:

Webhooks are triggered by an event (e.g., payment captured, new order, user signup).

HTTP-based:

Communication happens via HTTP POST requests (usually with JSON payload).

Two sides:

Receiving webhook: your server exposes a URL → another server calls it when an event happens.

Sending webhook: your server calls another server’s URL → to notify them when an event happens.

Security:

Usually verified using signatures or shared secrets, because webhooks are server-to-server.

Use case:

Works for asynchronous notifications (something happened, maybe delayed, maybe outside your control).

Alternative to polling the API constantly.

Analogy

Webhook = Event-based notification system between servers

Normal request = “I ask you now, give me a response”

Webhook = “I’ll tell you automatically when it happens”

Example Recap

Receiving webhook: Razorpay calls your Rails app when payment is captured.

Sending webhook: Your Rails app calls CRM or inventory server when order is created.

Both follow the same design pattern:

“When event X happens, POST this data to URL Y.”

So yes ✅, in essence:

Webhook is a design to send and receive HTTP requests automatically in response to specific events.
