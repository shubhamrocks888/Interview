Now let’s break it slowly and line-by-line, because this exact confusion is very common in interviews.

What happens when user clicks “Pay ₹500”?
Step 1️⃣ UI → Rails backend

Yes ✅
When user clicks ₹500, frontend calls your backend API:

POST /create_order


Up to this point → no Razorpay call yet

Now look at THIS line very carefully 👇
order = Razorpay::Order.create(
  amount: 50000,
  currency: 'INR'
)

🔥 THIS LINE CALLS RAZORPAY API 🔥

Behind the scenes, this gem does:

POST https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders


with:

amount = 50000

currency = INR

auth = key_id + secret

So YES, Razorpay third-party server is contacted here.

Full flow with clarity
User clicks Pay ₹500
        ↓
Frontend → Rails API (/create_order)
        ↓
Rails → Razorpay Orders API   ✅ (HERE)
        ↓
Razorpay → returns order_id
        ↓
Rails → Frontend (order_id)


👉 Money is NOT involved yet
👉 Only an order reference is created

Why do we call Razorpay here if no payment yet?
Because Razorpay needs:

A server-generated order

A fixed amount

A trusted reference

This ensures:
❌ User cannot change amount
❌ Fake payment success is impossible

💡 Interview line:

Order creation locks the amount on Razorpay’s server.

When does REAL payment happen then?
👉 NOT here ❌
👉 Happens later in frontend checkout
new Razorpay(options).open()


This opens Razorpay UI and:

talks to bank

handles OTP / UPI

debits money

Timeline Summary (MEMORIZE)
Step	Who talks	Razorpay involved?	Money
Click Pay	UI → Rails	❌	❌
Create Order	Rails → Razorpay	✅	❌
Checkout	UI → Razorpay	✅	✅
Verify	Rails → Razorpay	✅	❌
Interview-Ready Answer (Perfect)

Yes, Razorpay API is called while creating the order.
This creates an order reference on Razorpay’s server, but no money is deducted at this stage.
Actual payment happens later during Razorpay Checkout on the client side.
