1️⃣ Creating a Razorpay account

You (or your company) sign up on Razorpay
 and choose a plan (there’s a free plan too).

Once the account is active, Razorpay provides API credentials in the dashboard.

2️⃣ The credentials

In your Razorpay dashboard → Settings → API Keys, you get:

Credential	Purpose
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID	Public key — used in frontend or client-side for checkout (exposed safely)
RAZORPAY_SECRET	Secret key — used in your backend/server to authenticate API calls (like creating orders, issuing refunds)

Important: Never expose RAZORPAY_SECRET in frontend code. Always keep it on your server.

3️⃣ Relation to subscription/payment

You don’t get these keys only after subscribing.

Keys are part of your Razorpay account. Paying for a subscription plan just unlocks advanced features like higher limits, access to subscriptions API, etc.

For basic order/payment APIs, you already get test/live keys on account creation.

4️⃣ How it’s used in Rails
# config/initializers/razorpay.rb
Razorpay.setup(ENV['RAZORPAY_KEY_ID'], ENV['RAZORPAY_SECRET'])


RAZORPAY_KEY_ID → frontend checkout

RAZORPAY_SECRET → backend API calls

Then you can create orders, capture payments, or issue refunds securely.
