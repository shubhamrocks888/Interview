Short answer (clear & correct)

👉 Yes, the Razorpay key_id does not change.
👉 Frontend can store it.
👉 But many backends still send it with the order response for architectural and security reasons.

Now let’s go deeper.

What is this key actually used for?
new Razorpay({
  key: "rzp_test_xxxxx",  // this key
  order_id: "order_123"
})


🔹 This is PUBLIC key (key_id)
🔹 It is used only to:

Identify which Razorpay merchant

Load Razorpay Checkout

📌 It cannot create orders, refunds, or verify payments

So yes ✅ it’s safe for frontend.

Why backend sends key with every order (even if static)?
1️⃣ Environment flexibility (MOST COMMON REAL REASON)

Different environments use different keys:

Environment	Key
Local	rzp_test_xxx
Staging	rzp_test_yyy
Production	rzp_live_zzz

By sending from backend:

Frontend stays environment-agnostic

No hardcoding

No redeploy frontend if key changes

📌 Interview line:

Backend is the source of truth for configuration.

2️⃣ Frontend simplicity & safety

Frontend logic becomes:

Call create_order → get everything needed → open checkout


Frontend does NOT need to:

Read env variables

Manage secrets

Know which key to use

Less config = fewer bugs

3️⃣ Multi-merchant / multi-tenant systems

Imagine:

One Rails app

Multiple sellers

Each seller has their own Razorpay account

Then:

key = merchant.razorpay_key_id


Sending key dynamically is mandatory.

📌 Interview killer line:

Dynamic key support enables multi-merchant systems.

4️⃣ Security policy consistency

Rule followed in most companies:

Frontend never owns payment configuration

Even public keys are:

Served by backend

Controlled centrally

Is it WRONG for frontend to store the key?

❌ Not wrong
❌ Not insecure

But:

Less flexible

Less scalable

Less enterprise-friendly

Interview-Perfect Answer (MEMORIZE)

Although the Razorpay key_id is static and public, it is usually sent from the backend so that frontend remains environment-agnostic, configuration is centralized, and the system can support multiple merchants or key rotations without frontend changes.

Final Mental Model 🧠
Secret key → server only
Public key → frontend uses
But backend still DISTRIBUTES it
