PostgreSQL is an advanced, feature-rich, object-relational database that focuses on data integrity, complex queries, and strict SQL compliance.
It’s preferred when applications need complex joins, transactions, JSON support, and strong consistency.

MySQL is a fast, lightweight relational database designed for simplicity and high read performance.
It’s commonly used for web applications where speed and ease of use matter more than advanced querying.

One-line comparison (interviewer gold ✨)

Choose PostgreSQL → fintech, analytics, SaaS, complex business logic

Choose MySQL → blogs, CMS, simple CRUD, read-heavy apps
