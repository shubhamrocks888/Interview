Why PostgreSQL is called Object-Relational (ORDBMS)

PostgreSQL goes beyond tables and supports object-like features inside the database:

Custom Data Types

You can create your own types (ENUMs, composite types, JSON, arrays).

Example: a address type with street, city, pincode.

Table Inheritance

One table can inherit from another (similar to class inheritance).

Useful for polymorphic-like behavior.

Functions & Procedures as First-Class Objects

Functions can return complex types, tables, JSON, etc.

Functions themselves are treated like database objects.

Advanced JSON & Array Support

PostgreSQL treats JSON, arrays, hstore as native objects, not hacks.

📌 Because of these object-like abstractions, PostgreSQL is called an
Object-Relational Database.

Why MySQL is called a Relational Database

MySQL sticks closely to the traditional relational model:

Tables, Rows, Columns

Data is primarily stored and accessed in flat tables.

Limited Custom Types

Mostly standard SQL types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.).

No Table Inheritance

Relationships are handled via foreign keys only.

Procedures exist, but limited

Stored procedures are more restricted and less expressive.

📌 So MySQL focuses on relations between tables, not object behavior.

One-liner you can use in interviews 🎯

PostgreSQL is object-relational because it supports custom types, inheritance, and complex data structures inside the database, whereas MySQL follows a traditional relational model focused on tables and foreign keys.

Rails-friendly explanation (bonus)

PostgreSQL aligns better with Rails’ rich domain models because it can store structured data (JSON, arrays) and enforce complex constraints at the database level.
