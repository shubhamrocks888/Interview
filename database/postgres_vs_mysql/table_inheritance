Example: Table Inheritance (PostgreSQL only)
PostgreSQL supports table inheritance

MySQL does NOT.

PostgreSQL example
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE admins (
  role TEXT
) INHERITS (users);


Now:

INSERT INTO admins (name, role)
VALUES ('Shubham', 'super_admin');


And this works 👇

SELECT * FROM users;


➡️ It returns both users AND admins

Why this proves Object-Relational behavior

admins inherits columns from users

Acts like class inheritance

Parent table can query child records

This is not possible in MySQL

📌 MySQL has no table inheritance at all — you must use joins or STI-like patterns.

Interview one-liner 🎯

PostgreSQL supports table inheritance, where one table can inherit another like classes, which is a core object-relational feature not available in MySQL.




###### example

n PostgreSQL, string is not a valid data type. You need to use VARCHAR, TEXT, etc.

❌ What’s wrong
name string,
email string


Postgres doesn’t have a string type (that’s more of a Rails / ORM concept).

✅ Correct PostgreSQL syntax (using inheritance)
CREATE TABLE users (
  name  TEXT,
  email TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE admins (
  role TEXT
) INHERITS (users);


This is valid Postgres syntax, and admins will inherit:

name

email

from the users table.

⚠️ Important Postgres inheritance gotchas (interview gold)

Postgres table inheritance is rarely used in real apps. A few key things to know:

1️⃣ Queries on parent don’t include children by default (unless you want them to)
SELECT * FROM users;


⬆️ This will include admins rows by default.

To get only users (excluding admins):

SELECT * FROM ONLY users;

2️⃣ Constraints are NOT fully inherited

PRIMARY KEY

UNIQUE

FOREIGN KEY

👉 These do NOT automatically apply to child tables.

Example:

ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_email_unique UNIQUE (email);


⬆️ This does NOT enforce uniqueness across admins.

This is one big reason people avoid inheritance.

3️⃣ Rails does NOT support Postgres inheritance

ActiveRecord:

doesn’t understand inherited tables

won’t auto-load columns correctly

causes pain with validations & associations

👉 Rails prefers:

Single Table Inheritance (STI), or

Separate tables with foreign keys

✅ Rails-friendly alternative (recommended)

If this is for a Rails system:

Option 1: STI (most common)
# users table
type:string
name:string
email:string
role:string

class User < ApplicationRecord; end
class Admin < User; end

Option 2: Separate tables (clean + explicit)
users(id, name, email)
admins(id, user_id, role)

📌 Interview one-liner

“Postgres supports table inheritance syntactically, but because constraints and Rails ORM support are weak, it’s rarely used in production. In Rails apps, STI or explicit foreign-key tables are preferred.”
