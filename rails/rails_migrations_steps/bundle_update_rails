What bundle update rails really does
bundle update rails


👉 Bundler will:

Update rails

Update all gems that are direct dependencies of Rails, such as:

activesupport

activerecord

actionpack

actionmailer

railties

Update their transitive dependencies if required

But ❗ It will NOT update unrelated gems like:

sidekiq

devise

pundit

rspec

(unless Rails explicitly requires a newer version)

Why this happens

Rails is a meta-gem.

gem 'rails'


actually pulls in:

rails
 ├─ actionpack
 ├─ activerecord
 ├─ activesupport
 ├─ actionmailer
 ├─ actionview
 ├─ railties


So Bundler must update all of these together.

With --conservative
bundle update rails --conservative


👉 This means:

Update Rails only as much as needed

Avoid updating other gems unless unavoidable

This is the recommended command for upgrades.

What will NOT be updated

Gem	Updated?

r| Gem           | Updated? |
| ------------- | -------- |
| rails         | ✅ Yes    |
| activerecord  | ✅ Yes    |
| activesupport | ✅ Yes    |
| sidekiq       | ❌ No     |
| devise        | ❌ No     |
| pry           | ❌ No     |

Quick mental model 🧠

bundle update → everything

bundle update rails → rails + its dependency tree

bundle update rails --conservative → rails + minimum required deps

Interview one-liner 🎯

bundle update rails updates Rails and its dependent gems, but not unrelated gems. Using --conservative limits the changes to the minimum required versions.
