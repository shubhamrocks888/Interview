bundle update --conservative respects the version constraints in the Gemfile, such as ~> 5.2.4, and updates gems only within that range and only when necessary.

##

🎯 Interview-ready one-liner

bundle update <gem> targets a specific gem and may update its dependencies, while bundle update --conservative minimizes dependency changes and only updates what is strictly required within the Gemfile constraints.

###

🎯 Interview-ready explanation

Running bundle update without arguments updates all gems and their dependencies to the latest versions allowed by the Gemfile, often causing large lockfile changes and higher risk of regressions.
