🔥 Top Devise Interview Questions (Must-Know)
1️⃣ What is Devise?
✅ Short answer

Devise is a Rails authentication framework built on top of Warden that handles login, logout, password encryption, sessions, and user management.

🔍 Deep explanation

Authentication = verifying identity

Devise wraps Warden (Rack middleware)

Provides helpers like current_user, authenticate_user!

2️⃣ Is Devise authentication or authorization?
✅ Short answer

Devise is for authentication, not authorization.

🔍 Deep explanation

Authentication → who are you?

Authorization → what can you do?

Authorization is handled by Pundit / CanCanCan

3️⃣ How does Devise store passwords?
✅ Short answer

Devise uses bcrypt to store encrypted passwords in the encrypted_password column.

🔍 Deep explanation

Plain passwords are never stored

Uses one-way hashing

BCrypt::Password.create(password)

Compared during login, never decrypted

4️⃣ Where does Devise store logged-in user information?
✅ Short answer

Devise stores the user ID in the session via Warden.

🔍 Deep explanation

Uses cookies → session → Warden

Internally:

env['warden'].set_user(user)


Session cookie contains session ID, not user data

5️⃣ How does current_user work?
✅ Short answer

current_user fetches the logged-in user from Warden using session data.

🔍 Deep explanation

Reads user ID from session

Fetches record from DB

Memoized per request

Equivalent to:

env['warden'].user

6️⃣ What is Warden?
✅ Short answer

Warden is a Rack-based authentication middleware that Devise is built on.

🔍 Deep explanation

Runs before Rails controller

Handles authentication strategies

Manages session storage

Devise = Rails wrapper around Warden

7️⃣ What is authenticate_user!?
✅ Short answer

It’s a Devise before_action that ensures a user is logged in.

🔍 Deep explanation

Checks current_user

Redirects to login if nil

Sets flash message

Internally calls Warden

8️⃣ What happens when a user logs in?
✅ Short answer

Devise authenticates credentials, stores user in session, and makes current_user available.

🔍 Deep explanation (step-by-step)

User submits login form

Devise controller receives params

Warden verifies credentials

Password compared via bcrypt

User ID stored in session

9️⃣ What is rememberable?
✅ Short answer

It allows users to stay logged in using cookies even after session expiry.

🔍 Deep explanation

Generates a remember token

Stores hashed token in DB

Stores signed cookie in browser

Re-authenticates user automatically

🔟 Difference between session and remember me?
✅ Short answer

Session is short-lived; remember me is persistent using cookies.

🔍 Deep explanation
Session	Remember Me
Stored in server session	Stored in browser cookie
Cleared on browser close	Persists for weeks
Faster	More secure tokens
1️⃣1️⃣ What is recoverable?
✅ Short answer

It handles password reset functionality.

🔍 Deep explanation

Generates reset token

Sends email

Token expires

Password updated securely

1️⃣2️⃣ What is confirmable?
✅ Short answer

It requires email confirmation before allowing login.

🔍 Deep explanation

Sends confirmation email

Blocks login until confirmed

Prevents fake signups

1️⃣3️⃣ What is lockable?
✅ Short answer

It locks user accounts after multiple failed login attempts.

🔍 Deep explanation

Prevents brute-force attacks

Tracks failed attempts

Unlock via email or time

1️⃣4️⃣ What is timeoutable?
✅ Short answer

It automatically logs out users after inactivity.

🔍 Deep explanation

Uses last_activity_at

Compares with timeout window

Clears session

1️⃣5️⃣ What database fields does Devise add?
✅ Short answer

Devise adds fields like email, encrypted_password, tokens, timestamps depending on enabled modules.

🔍 Common fields
encrypted_password
reset_password_token
remember_created_at
confirmation_token
failed_attempts

1️⃣6️⃣ Can Devise work in API-only apps?
✅ Short answer

Yes, but usually combined with JWT or token-based authentication.

🔍 Deep explanation

Sessions not ideal for APIs

Devise + JWT or Devise Token Auth

Uses headers instead of cookies

1️⃣7️⃣ How do you customize Devise controllers?
✅ Short answer

By generating Devise controllers and overriding them.

rails generate devise:controllers users

1️⃣8️⃣ How do you add extra fields (like username)?
✅ Short answer

By permitting parameters using before_action.

devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up, keys: [:username])

1️⃣9️⃣ Devise vs Custom Authentication?
✅ Short answer

Devise is safer and faster to implement; custom auth offers flexibility but higher risk.

🔍 Deep explanation

Devise handles edge cases

Custom auth easy to break security

Devise is production-tested

2️⃣0️⃣ Biggest drawbacks of Devise?
✅ Short answer

Less flexibility, heavy abstraction, harder debugging.

🔍 Deep explanation

Magic methods

Hidden Warden behavior

Overkill for simple apps
