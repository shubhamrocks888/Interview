1️⃣ What is Rails.cache?

	Rails.cache is a key–value store used to avoid expensive operations like:

	DB queries
	API calls
	Heavy computations

	It sits outside your app process (Redis / Memcached / FileStore / MemoryStore).


				OR

	Rails.cache is a unified caching API. Whether it sits outside the app process depends on the configured cache store.

	MemoryStore 		→ inside the process
	FileStore 			→ outside process but local
	Redis / Memcached 	→ fully outside the app process




	When should you use what?

	✅ Use Rails.cache when:

		You are caching derived / temporary data

		Data can be safely evicted

		You want expiration, fetch, race protection

		You may change cache backend later

		👉 90% of app caching

	✅ Use Redis directly when:

		Redis is a primary system component

		You need:

		Background jobs

		Rate limiting

		Locks

		Pub/Sub

		Queues

		Counters

		👉 Business logic depends on Redis

		Interview-quality answer (memorize this)

		Even if Rails.cache uses Redis underneath, Rails.cache and Redis are not the same.
		Rails.cache treats Redis as a cache with Rails-level features like expiration, serialization, and fetch semantics, whereas direct Redis usage treats it as a datastore and requires manual handling.
