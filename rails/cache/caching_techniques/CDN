Yes 👍 — CDN is used by us (the people who own the Rails app).
Now let’s answer why we use it, from first principles, with zero confusion.

1️⃣ Why CDN exists (core reason)

CDNs are used to make your app faster and more scalable by serving content closer to users and reducing load on your servers.

That’s the one-line reason.

2️⃣ The real problem without a CDN

Assume:

Your Rails app servers are in Mumbai

A user opens your site from New York

Without CDN:
User (New York)
   ↓  (200–300 ms latency)
Rails server (Mumbai)


Problems:

High latency (slow page load)

Every request hits your server

Your server must handle all traffic

Scaling becomes expensive

3️⃣ What CDN actually does

CDN has edge servers around the world.

User (New York)
   ↓
CDN Edge (New York)
   ↓ (only if cache miss)
Rails server (Mumbai)

4️⃣ What is cached on CDN?

Using HTTP caching headers, CDN can cache:

Full HTML pages (page caching)

JSON API responses

Images, JS, CSS

Assets from Rails pipeline

Example header from Rails:

Cache-Control: public, max-age=600


Meaning:

“Anyone may cache this response for 10 minutes.”

5️⃣ What happens on next request?
User → CDN Edge → HTML returned


Rails server is NOT hit

Nginx is NOT hit

DB is NOT hit

🚀 Massive speed improvement

6️⃣ Why CDN is better than reverse proxy alone

Reverse proxy (Nginx) is usually in one location.

CDN:

Has servers in many locations

Reduces geographical latency

Absorbs traffic spikes

Protects from DDoS attacks

7️⃣ Do small Rails apps need CDN?

Not always.

You usually add CDN when:

App is public-facing

Users are global

Traffic is high

Pages are mostly read-only

8️⃣ Typical Rails production setup
User
 ↓
Browser Cache
 ↓
CDN (Cloudflare)
 ↓
Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
 ↓
Rails App

9️⃣ One-line interview answer

CDNs are used in Rails applications to cache and serve content closer to users, reduce latency, offload traffic from application servers, and improve scalability using HTTP caching.

10️⃣ Ultra-simple mental model

CDN = your app’s global cache layer

Final clarification to your question

“its used by us who have the Rails app”

✅ Yes

You configure it

You pay for it

You control caching rules (via Rails headers)
