1️⃣ What is Page Caching? (Exact definition)

Page caching means caching the entire HTML response of a page and serving it directly from the web server without hitting Rails at all.

No:

controller

model

view

database

Rails is completely bypassed.

2️⃣ How Page Caching Works (conceptually)
First request:

Request comes to Rails

Controller action runs

View renders HTML

HTML is saved as a static file

Response is returned

Next request:

Request comes in

Web server (Nginx/Apache) finds cached HTML

HTML is returned directly

Rails never runs

3️⃣ Simple Example (Blog posts page)

Route:

GET /posts


Controller:

class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end

Cached result:
public/posts.html


Now:

Visiting /posts

Server returns posts.html

Rails is skipped entirely 🚀

4️⃣ Why Page Caching Is FAST
Step	Fragment caching	Page caching
Rails boot	✅ Yes	❌ No
Controller	✅ Yes	❌ No
View rendering	Partial	❌ No
DB queries	Often	❌ No
Web server only	❌	✅

👉 Fastest possible caching

5️⃣ Why Rails Removed Built-in Page Caching

Page caching was removed after Rails 3 because:

❌ No user-specific content
❌ Hard to expire
❌ Doesn’t work well with auth / sessions
❌ Breaks dynamic pages

So Rails moved to:

HTTP caching

Reverse proxy caching

Fragment caching

6️⃣ Modern Rails Page Caching (How it’s done now)

Instead of Rails doing it, we use:

🔹 Nginx / Varnish / Cloudflare

Rails sends headers:

expires_in 10.minutes, public: true


Web server / CDN caches the full page.

7️⃣ Page Caching vs Fragment Caching
Feature	Page caching	Fragment caching
Cached content	Entire page HTML	Part of page
Rails involved	❌ No	✅ Yes
Per-user content	❌ No	✅ Yes
Speed	🚀 Fastest	Fast
Flexibility	Low	High
8️⃣ When to Use Page Caching

✅ Public pages
✅ Same content for everyone
✅ Rarely changing pages

Examples:

Landing pages

Marketing pages

Blogs (public view)

Documentation

9️⃣ When NOT to Use Page Caching

❌ Logged-in pages
❌ Personalized dashboards
❌ Pages with sessions / cookies
❌ Admin panels

10️⃣ One-Line Interview Answer

Page caching stores the entire rendered HTML of a page and serves it directly from the web server, completely bypassing Rails for maximum performance.

Mental model

Fragment caching = cache parts
Russian doll = cache parts + container
Page caching = cache everything
