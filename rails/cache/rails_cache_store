Correct statement

	Rails.cache stores data as key–value pairs, and the value can be almost anything.

What “value can be anything” really means

Rails.cache can store any Ruby object that can be serialized.

Common valid values
Rails.cache.write("a", 1)                 # Integer
Rails.cache.write("b", "hello")           # String
Rails.cache.write("c", [1, 2, 3])          # Array
Rails.cache.write("d", { x: 1 })           # Hash
Rails.cache.write("e", User.find(1))       # ActiveRecord object ⚠️
Rails.cache.write("f", Time.current)       # Time


Rails serializes these → stores bytes → deserializes on read.


What you should NOT store (even if it works)
	❌ Objects with live state
	Rails.cache.write("conn", ActiveRecord::Base.connection)
	Rails.cache.write("proc", -> { do_something })
	Rails.cache.write("io", File.open("a.txt"))


	These either:

	Fail to serialize

	Deserialize incorrectly

	Cause subtle bugs

⚠️ Special warning: ActiveRecord objects

This works:

Rails.cache.write("user", User.first)


But it’s dangerous because:

Stale attributes

Associations not loaded

Schema changes break deserialization

Better:
Rails.cache.write("user", User.first.attributes)

or:

Rails.cache.write("user", User.first.as_json)


Key rules to memorize
	Rule 1

	Value must be serializable

	Rule 2

	Value must be safe to be stale

	Rule 3

	Value must be recomputable

	If any rule fails → ❌ don’t cache it.



What about keys?

Keys are:

Strings (recommended)

Symbols (converted to strings)

Rails.cache.write("users/count", 10)
Rails.cache.write(:users_count, 10)

Interview-ready one-liner

Rails.cache stores key–value pairs where the value can be any serializable Ruby object, but it should only be used for temporary, reproducible data.
