MemoryStore and Memcached are both in-memory and non-persistent, but they differ in scope, scalability, and usage.

Key Differences: MemoryStore vs Memcached

1️⃣ Where Data Lives (MOST IMPORTANT)

| MemoryStore                     | Memcached                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Inside **Rails process memory** | Separate **external service** |
| Per Rails server                | Shared across servers         |

📌 Interview line:

“MemoryStore is local to one Rails process; Memcached is centralized.”

2️⃣ Multi-Server Support

| Feature                         | MemoryStore | Memcached |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Works with multiple app servers | ❌           | ✅         |
| Shared cache                    | ❌           | ✅         |

📌 This is the biggest difference.

3️⃣ Persistence

| MemoryStore     | Memcached       |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| No persistence  | No persistence  |
| Lost on restart | Lost on restart |

✔ Here they are similar.

4️⃣ Performance
| MemoryStore            | Memcached                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Very fast (no network) | Slightly slower (network call) |

📌 Interview line:

“MemoryStore is fastest but not scalable.”

5️⃣ Eviction & Size Control

| MemoryStore          | Memcached    |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Limited size control | LRU eviction |
| Can bloat app memory | Fixed memory |


6️⃣ Thread & Process Safety

| MemoryStore                  | Memcached   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Thread-safe                  | Thread-safe |
| Not shared between processes | Shared      |


Rails Configuration Example
# MemoryStore
config.cache_store = :memory_store

# Memcached
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, "cache.example.com"

When to Use What (INTERVIEW GOLD)
	✅ Use MemoryStore when:

	Single server

	Development

	Small apps

	Temporary caching

	✅ Use Memcached when:

	Multiple app servers

	Shared cache needed

	Simple caching only

One-Line Interview Answer ⭐

“MemoryStore is per-process in-memory caching, while Memcached is a centralized in-memory cache shared across servers.”

Extra Interview Follow-up ❓

Q: Why is MemoryStore dangerous in production?

Because cache is duplicated across servers and increases memory usage per process.
