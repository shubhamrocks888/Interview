Your code
if: -> { premium_user? && active? }

What this is

-> { ... } is lambda syntax

Rails accepts it as a callable object

Internally, Rails treats it as a Proc

So conceptually: lambda
technically in Ruby: Proc object created via lambda syntax

Proof in plain Ruby
condition = -> { premium_user? && active? }

condition.class
# => Proc

condition.lambda?
# => true


✔️ Confirms it’s a lambda

How Rails uses it

Rails does NOT execute it immediately.

Instead:

Stores the lambda

Calls it during validation

Executes it in the context of the model instance

That’s why this works:

premium_user?
active?


Without self.

Lambda vs Proc (quick clarity)
Feature	lambda (->)	Proc
Syntax	-> {}	Proc.new {}
return behavior	Returns from lambda	Returns from method
Arity	Strict	Lenient

Rails supports both, but prefers lambdas.

Rails also allows this form
if: ->(user) { user.premium_user? && user.active? }


Same result, sometimes clearer.

Interview one-liner 🚀

“Yes, -> {} is lambda syntax in Ruby. Rails stores it and evaluates it during validation in the context of the model instance.”

Tiny syntax nitpick 👀

You had an extra | at the end:

if: -> { premium_user? && active? }|


❌ Invalid Ruby
✅ Correct version:

if: -> { premium_user? && active? }
