saved_change_to_status? comes from ActiveRecord Dirty Tracking, not from enum.

🔎 What exactly is saved_change_to_status?

It is a dirty tracking helper method automatically generated by ActiveRecord for every attribute.

Since you have a status column, Rails generates:

saved_change_to_status?
saved_change_to_status
status_before_last_save

🧠 What does it do?

saved_change_to_status?

👉 Returns true if status was changed in the last save

It only works after the record has been saved.

Example
order.status = :completed
order.save

order.saved_change_to_status?
# => true

order.saved_change_to_status
# => ["requested", "completed"]

order.status_before_last_save
# => "requested"

❗ Important Difference

There are 3 types of dirty methods people confuse:

1️⃣ Before saving
will_save_change_to_status?
status_change_to_be_saved


Used inside validations or before_save.

2️⃣ After saving
saved_change_to_status?
saved_change_to_status
status_before_last_save


Used inside after_save, after_commit.

3️⃣ Old Rails (deprecated style)
status_changed?
status_change


Used before Rails 5.2.

🧩 Why is it dynamic?

Rails uses ActiveModel::Dirty to dynamically define:

saved_change_to_<attribute>?
saved_change_to_<attribute>
will_save_change_to_<attribute>?


So if your column was:

amount


You’d get:

saved_change_to_amount?

🚀 In Short

saved_change_to_status? is:

✔ NOT from enum

✔ From ActiveRecord dirty tracking

✔ Checks if attribute changed in last save

✔ Commonly used in callbacks

Interview-style explanation (30 sec version)
