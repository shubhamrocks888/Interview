➡ It is a predefined regular expression provided by Ruby’s standard library
➡ Used to validate email address format

It lives in:

URI::MailTo


module (part of Ruby’s uri library)

Is it Rails or Ruby? 🤔

It is Ruby standard library, not Rails-specific

Rails simply uses and recommends it.

So the correct wording is:

“It’s a Ruby standard library regex commonly used in Rails apps.”

Why does it exist?

Email RFC rules are complex

Writing a perfect regex is risky

Ruby provides a well-tested, maintained solution

Rails encourages reuse instead of custom regex

What problem does it solve?

It validates:

Presence of @

Valid local and domain parts

No illegal characters

Common real-world email formats

But it does NOT:

Check if email exists

Send verification

Guarantee RFC perfection

How it’s used in Rails models
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email,
    presence: true,
    format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
end
