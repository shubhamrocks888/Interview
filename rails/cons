❌ Cons of Rails
1. Performance Issues

Rails apps can be slower than Node.js, Go, or Java.

Large apps may face CPU and memory bottlenecks.

Con: Not ideal for CPU-intensive or real-time apps.

2. Learning Curve

Beginners must understand: MVC, CoC, REST, ActiveRecord, gems, routing.

Lots of “magic” can be confusing.

Con: Can overwhelm new developers.

3. Monolithic Framework

Rails apps tend to become large and monolithic if not carefully structured.

Harder to adopt microservices unless explicitly designed that way.

4. Memory Consumption

Rails apps are memory-heavy, especially when scaling horizontally.

Con: More server resources needed for larger apps.

5. Boot Time & Startup Delay

Rails apps (especially with many gems) can take longer to boot.

Not ideal for serverless or instant command-line scripts.

6. Too Much “Magic”

Rails abstracts many things (ActiveRecord, helpers, callbacks).

If something goes wrong, debugging can be difficult.

Con: Can hide complex operations and cause unexpected behavior.

7. Scaling Complexity

Horizontal scaling requires extra care (caching, background jobs, DB optimization).

Vertical scaling alone is often not sufficient.
