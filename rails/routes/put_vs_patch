🔹 PUT vs PATCH (What the HTTP spec says)
✅ PUT (Replace the resource)

Semantics: replace the entire resource

Client is supposed to send the full representation

Missing fields may be considered removed or reset

✅ PATCH (Partial update)

Semantics: update only the provided fields

Unsent fields remain unchanged

📘 This is what REST / HTTP standards say.

🔹 Why in Rails PUT behaves like PATCH
👉 Rails does NOT enforce PUT semantics

In Rails:

PUT   /users/:id  → users#update
PATCH /users/:id  → users#update


Both go to the same controller action:

def update
  @user.update(user_params)
end


Rails only updates attributes you permit and send.

🔍 Example (Rails behavior)
Request
PUT /users/1
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John"
  }
}

What Rails does
@user.update(name: "John")


👉 Email, age, etc. remain unchanged
👉 Rails treats it like PATCH

🧠 Why nothing “breaks” with PUT in Rails

Because:

ActiveRecord update performs a partial update

Missing attributes are ignored, not nulled

Strong parameters prevent mass replacement

Rails optimizes for developer safety, not strict REST purity.

🔥 Important Interview Insight

PUT vs PATCH difference is contractual, not technical.

Rails allows PUT to behave like PATCH because:

Full replacement is risky

Clients often don’t have full state

Partial updates are safer

❗ When PUT would behave differently

PUT behaves like a full replacement only if you implement it that way:

def update
  @user.assign_attributes(default_attributes)
  @user.assign_attributes(user_params)
  @user.save
end


OR if your API explicitly nullifies missing fields.

Rails does not do this by default.

📊 Quick Comparison
Aspect	PUT	PATCH
HTTP spec	Replace resource	Partial update
Rails behavior	Partial update	Partial update
Controller action	update	update
Missing fields	Ignored	Ignored
Enforced by Rails?	❌ No	❌ No
🎯 Correct Interview Answer (Best)

“According to HTTP spec, PUT replaces a resource while PATCH partially updates it. However, in Rails both PUT and PATCH are routed to the same update action and behave the same unless explicitly implemented otherwise.”

⭐ Bonus: Why Rails prefers PATCH

Rails scaffolds use PATCH because:

Matches real behavior

Safer

More REST-accurate

That’s why you’ll see:

<%= form_with model: @user do |f| %>


➡ generates PATCH, not PUT.

🧠 One-Line Summary

PUT and PATCH differ by intent, but Rails treats both as partial updates unless you enforce full replacement logic.
