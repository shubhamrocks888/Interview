🔹 resources :users — How many routes?
✅ Answer: 7 RESTful routes
resources :users


Rails automatically creates 7 routes.

📌 The 7 RESTful Routes
HTTP Verb	Path	Controller#Action	Purpose
GET	/users	users#index	List all users
GET	/users/new	users#new	Form to create user
POST	/users	users#create	Create user
GET	/users/:id	users#show	Show user
GET	/users/:id/edit	users#edit	Edit user form
PATCH / PUT	/users/:id	users#update	Update user
DELETE	/users/:id	users#destroy	Delete user
🧠 Why exactly 7?

Rails follows REST conventions:

Collection actions → index, create

Member actions → show, update, destroy

Form helpers → new, edit

🔍 Verify in Rails
rails routes | grep users

🔥 Interview One-Liner

"resources :users generates 7 RESTful routes corresponding to standard CRUD operations."

⭐ Bonus (Very Common Follow-ups)
👉 Only specific routes
resources :users, only: [:index, :show]


➡ Creates 2 routes

👉 Excluding routes
resources :users, except: [:destroy]


➡ Creates 6 routes

👉 Singular resource
resource :profile


➡ Creates 6 routes (no index)

If you want, I can also explain:

resource vs resources

Nested routes (users/:user_id/posts)

REST vs non-REST routes (interview trick questions)

Just tell me 🚀

resources :users do
  resources :posts, shallow: true
end

###what route it will produce

This is a classic Rails interview question.
Let’s break it slowly and clearly, then list all routes produced.

Code
resources :users do
  resources :posts, shallow: true
end

🔹 What does shallow: true mean?

👉 Collection routes stay nested
👉 Member routes become non-nested

In simple words:

Routes that need user_id → stay nested

Routes that operate on a specific post (:id) → become shallow

🧩 Generated Routes (TOTAL: 8)
🔸 User Routes (7 standard REST routes)
GET    /users          → users#index
GET    /users/new      → users#new
POST   /users          → users#create
GET    /users/:id      → users#show
GET    /users/:id/edit → users#edit
PATCH  /users/:id      → users#update
DELETE /users/:id      → users#destroy

🔸 Post Routes (Shallow)
✅ Nested (collection-level)

These require user_id because they create or list posts for a user.

GET  /users/:user_id/posts     → posts#index
POST /users/:user_id/posts     → posts#create
GET  /users/:user_id/posts/new → posts#new

✅ Shallow (member-level)

These work on a specific post, so user_id is NOT needed.

GET    /posts/:id      → posts#show
GET    /posts/:id/edit → posts#edit
PATCH  /posts/:id      → posts#update
DELETE /posts/:id      → posts#destroy

📊 Summary Table
Type	Route Example
Nested	/users/:user_id/posts
Shallow	/posts/:id
🧠 Why use shallow: true?
❌ Without shallow
/users/1/posts/99/edit

✅ With shallow
/posts/99/edit


✔ Cleaner URLs
✔ Less redundancy
✔ Still keeps logical nesting

🔥 Interview One-Liner

"shallow: true keeps collection routes nested under the parent resource but makes member routes independent, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable URLs."

⭐ Common Follow-up Questions (Interview)
❓ How many post routes?

👉 7 routes (same REST actions, just split nested + shallow)

❓ When NOT to use shallow?

When child resource must always depend on parent context
