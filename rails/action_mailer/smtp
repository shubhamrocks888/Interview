🧠 First, simple definition (no jargon)

An adapter is a translator between Rails and the outside world.

Rails doesn’t know how to send an email.
It only knows what an email is.

So Rails says:

“Here’s an email. Someone please deliver it.”

The adapter is that someone.

📦 In Action Mailer terms
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp


Here:

:smtp = adapter

It tells Rails which delivery mechanism to use

Other adapters:

:smtp
:sendmail
:test
:file


Each adapter knows how to send the email in its own way.

🔌 What exactly is SMTP then?
SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

Think of it as:

HTTP for emails

Just like:

HTTP sends web requests

SMTP sends emails

SMTP defines:

How to connect to a mail server

How to authenticate

How to send the message

📨 SMTP Adapter Flow (under the hood)
Rails (Action Mailer)
   ↓
Mail gem
   ↓
SMTP adapter
   ↓
SMTP server (Gmail / SES / Outlook)
   ↓
Recipient inbox


Rails does not implement SMTP itself.

The Mail gem’s SMTP adapter does.

🧠 Mental analogy (easy to remember)
Sending a letter 📬

Rails = writes the letter

Adapter = chooses delivery service

SMTP = India Post / FedEx

Recipient = mailbox

If tomorrow you change:

delivery_method = :sendgrid


You changed courier, not the letter.

⚙️ SMTP Adapter responsibilities

The SMTP adapter:

Opens TCP connection

Authenticates (username/password)

Sends email data

Handles retries / failures

Closes connection

Rails never deals with this directly.

🔁 Why adapters exist (VERY important)

Because Rails wants this:

UserMailer.welcome(user).deliver_later


To work without caring:

Gmail

Outlook

SES

Local dev

Test environment

Adapters make this pluggable.

🧪 Example: test adapter
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test


Here:

No SMTP

No network

Emails stored in memory

ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.last


Same API, different adapter.

🆚 SMTP vs API adapters (SendGrid, SES)
Adapter	How it sends
SMTP	Protocol-based
SendGrid API	HTTP REST
SES API	HTTP REST

But Rails code stays the same:

deliver_later


💎 That’s the power of adapters.

🗣️ Interview-perfect explanation (memorize)

“An adapter is the delivery mechanism Action Mailer uses to send emails.
SMTP is one such adapter that implements the SMTP protocol to talk to mail servers like Gmail or SES.”

If you say this calmly, interviewer will stop digging 😄

🔥 Bonus (senior-level)

Adapters are used everywhere in Rails:

ActiveStorage → S3 / Disk

ActiveJob → Sidekiq / Resque

ActionMailer → SMTP / SendGrid

Same design pattern.
