Nice one 👌 — this is a Rails Mailer classic, and interviewers love this comparison.

Both lines attach files to an email, but they behave very differently.

1️⃣ attachments["filename"] = File.read(path)
📌 What it does

Adds a regular file attachment to the email.

attachments["invoice.pdf"] = File.read("/tmp/invoice.pdf")

📬 How it appears to user

Shows up as a downloadable attachment

User must click to open/download

Not displayed inside email body

🧠 Use cases

PDFs

CSVs

Reports

Invoices

Any downloadable file

💡 Mental model

“This file is sent with the email”

2️⃣ attachments.inline["logo.png"] = File.read("app/assets/images/logo.png")
📌 What it does

Adds an inline attachment that can be rendered inside the email body.

attachments.inline["logo.png"] =
  File.read(Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/logo.png"))

📬 How it appears to user

Does NOT appear as a normal attachment

Can be embedded in HTML email:

<img src="cid:logo.png">

🧠 Use cases

Logos

Banners

Icons

Email branding images

💡 Mental model

“This file is part of the email HTML”

🔥 Side-by-side comparison (easy to remember)

| Feature              | attachments | attachments.inline |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Downloadable         | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No               |
| Display inside email | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes              |
| Used with `<img>`    | ❌           | ✅                  |
| Common use           | PDFs, files | Logos, images      |
| Requires `cid:`      | ❌           | ✅                  |

🧠 Why cid: is needed for inline

Inline attachments are referenced by Content-ID:

<img src="cid:logo.png">


Rails maps:

attachments.inline["logo.png"]


→ cid:logo.png

🚫 Common mistake (very common)
<img src="/assets/logo.png"> ❌


This won’t work in emails because:

Email clients don’t know your server

Assets pipeline is unavailable

✅ Always use cid: for inline images.

💎 Interview-ready answer (memorize this)

“attachments sends files as downloadable attachments, while
attachments.inline embeds files inside the email body using Content-ID,
commonly for images like logos.”

⚡ Pro tip (senior-level)

Always use absolute paths:

Rails.root.join("app/assets/images/logo.png")


Avoid hardcoded relative paths.
