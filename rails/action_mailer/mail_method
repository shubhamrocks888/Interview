Yes — mail has MANY options, not just to and subject.
Online tests love this question because most people only know those two.

I’ll give you everything you need, clearly categorized and easy to remember.

🔑 mail METHOD — FULL PICTURE

Basic syntax:

mail(options = {})


options is a hash.

1️⃣ MOST COMMONLY USED OPTIONS (MUST KNOW)
mail(
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "Welcome"
)

Option	Meaning
to	Recipient
subject	Email subject
2️⃣ VERY COMMON (INTERVIEW FAVORITES)
mail(
  to: user.email,
  from: "support@app.com",
  cc: "manager@app.com",
  bcc: "audit@app.com",
  reply_to: "help@app.com",
  subject: "Order Confirmed"
)

Option	Meaning
from	Sender address
cc	Carbon copy
bcc	Blind carbon copy
reply_to	Reply-to address
3️⃣ MULTIPLE RECIPIENTS (COMMON MCQ)
mail(
  to: ["a@test.com", "b@test.com"],
  cc: ["c@test.com"]
)


✔ Accepts string or array

4️⃣ HEADERS (RARE BUT IMPRESSIVE)
mail(
  to: user.email,
  subject: "Test",
  headers: {
    "X-Custom-Header" => "Value"
  }
)

5️⃣ CONTENT TYPE / FORMAT
mail(
  to: user.email,
  subject: "Hello",
  content_type: "text/html"
)


Usually not needed because Rails infers from views.

6️⃣ ATTACHMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
attachments["invoice.pdf"] = File.read("invoice.pdf")

mail(
  to: user.email,
  subject: "Invoice"
)


📌 Attachments are set before calling mail

7️⃣ TEMPLATE OVERRIDES (TRICK QUESTION)
mail(
  to: user.email,
  subject: "Welcome",
  template_name: "custom_template"
)


Looks for:

custom_template.html.erb

8️⃣ TEMPLATE PATH (RARE)
mail(
  to: user.email,
  subject: "Hello",
  template_path: "shared/mailer"
)

9️⃣ DEFAULT OPTIONS (CLEAN CODE)
class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
  default from: "no-reply@app.com"

  def welcome_email(user)
    @user = user
    mail(to: user.email, subject: "Welcome")
  end
end

🧠 MEMORY TRICK (FOR ONLINE TEST)

Remember T-F-C-B-R-S-A-T

To
From
Cc
Bcc
Reply_to
Subject
Attachments
Template


That alone covers 95% of questions.

❌ COMMON WRONG ASSUMPTIONS

❌ mail sends immediately
✔ deliver_now / deliver_later sends

❌ View must be passed explicitly
✔ Auto-mapped by method name

🧪 QUICK PRACTICE (ANSWER IN YOUR HEAD)

Send email to user and admin, attach invoice, set reply_to

attachments["invoice.pdf"] = File.read("invoice.pdf")

mail(
  to: user.email,
  cc: "admin@app.com",
  reply_to: "support@app.com",
  subject: "Invoice"
)

✅ INTERVIEW SAFE SUMMARY

If you know:

to

from

cc / bcc

reply_to

attachments

template_name

###############  template_path vs template_name

1️⃣ template_name

What it does:

Lets you override which view file is used for the email.

Only changes the filename, not the folder.

Example:

# Mailer method
def welcome_email(user)
  @user = user
  mail(
    to: user.email,
    subject: "Welcome",
    template_name: "special_welcome"
  )
end


Rails will look for:

app/views/user_mailer/special_welcome.html.erb
app/views/user_mailer/special_welcome.text.erb


✅ Folder stays the same: user_mailer
✅ Only the file name changes

2️⃣ template_path

What it does:

Lets you override the folder path where Rails looks for the view.

Useful if you want to reuse a shared template across multiple mailers.

Example:

def order_email(user)
  @user = user
  @order = order
  mail(
    to: user.email,
    subject: "Order Confirmed",
    template_path: "shared/mailer",
    template_name: "order_notification"
  )
end


Rails will look for:

app/views/shared/mailer/order_notification.html.erb
app/views/shared/mailer/order_notification.text.erb


✅ Folder is overridden: shared/mailer
✅ File name is overridden: order_notification
