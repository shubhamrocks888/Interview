🧠 Advanced: What is a Singleton Method in Ruby?

Ruby also has something called a singleton method, which is different.

It is a method defined on one specific object only.

str = "hello"

def str.shout
  upcase + "!"
end

puts str.shout  # HELLO!


That method exists only for that str object — not for all strings.
