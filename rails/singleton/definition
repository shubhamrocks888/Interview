Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
In Ruby, we usually implement it using include Singleton.


####

In Ruby, a Singleton is a design pattern that ensures:

Only one instance of a class can exist

That instance is globally accessible

🔹 Why Use Singleton?

You use Singleton when you want:

  A single configuration object
  A single logger
  A single cache
  A single connection manager

Example: You don’t want 10 different loggers writing differently — just one shared logger.

###

✅ Method 1: Using Ruby's Built-in Singleton Module (Recommended)

require 'singleton'

class Logger
  include Singleton

  def log(message)
    puts message
  end
end

logger1 = Logger.instance
logger2 = Logger.instance

puts logger1 == logger2  # true


🔎 What happens here?

  new becomes private

  You cannot do Logger.new

  You must use Logger.instance

  Only one object is created

⚠️ Important Interview Point

Singleton ensures:

Single object

Controlled access

Global point of access

But beware:

Can behave like a global variable

Harder to test

Can create tight coupling
