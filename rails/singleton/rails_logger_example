till dont understande..what I understand for EmailRateLimiter instance is the class method and  for Rails .logger --. logger is the class method..that you want to say

YES ✅ — what you just said is basically correct.

Let’s slow it down and make it crystal clear.

🔹 Case 1: EmailRateLimiter.instance
class EmailRateLimiter
  include Singleton
end


What happens here?

Singleton module adds a class method called .instance

That method returns the single object

So this:

EmailRateLimiter.instance


is just calling a class method named instance.

✔ instance is a class method
✔ It returns the one shared object

🔹 Case 2: Rails.logger

Now look at Rails:

Rails.logger


Here:

logger is also a class method

It returns the logger object

So this:

Rails.logger


is just calling a class method named logger.

✔ logger is a class method
✔ It returns the one shared object

🧠 So What’s The Difference?

There is NO conceptual difference.

Both are:

👉 A class method
👉 That returns a single shared instance

The only difference is the method name.

| Singleton Module | Rails Style      |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `.instance`      | `.logger`        |
| generic name     | custom name      |
| provided by Ruby | written manually |


🔥 Let Me Show You Something Mind-Blowing

These two are almost the same:

Version 1 – Using Singleton
class A
  include Singleton
end

A.instance

Version 2 – Manual Rails Style
class A
  def self.instance
    @instance ||= new
  end

  private_class_method :new
end

A.instance

Version 3 – Rails Custom Name
class A
  def self.logger
    @logger ||= new
  end

  private_class_method :new
end

A.logger


See?

The only difference is the method name.

🎯 Final Clarity Statement

You said:

for EmailRateLimiter instance is the class method and for Rails .logger -- .logger is the class method..that you want to say

👉 YES. Exactly.

Both are class methods.
Both return a single object.
Both behave like singleton.

The only difference is:

Singleton forces the method name to be .instance

Rails prefers meaningful names like .logger
