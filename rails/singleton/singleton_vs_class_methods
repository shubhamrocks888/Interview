🔥 What You Said (Refined)

We use Singleton when we want exactly one instance of a class in the entire application.
Making it Singleton communicates that intent clearly and prevents accidental multiple object creation.

That’s absolutely right.

🎯 Why That Matters

With a normal class:

config1 = AppConfig.new
config2 = AppConfig.new


Two objects can exist.

Even if developers shouldn’t create two… they still can.

With Singleton:

AppConfig.instance


No one can do:

AppConfig.new   # ❌ error


It enforces:

👉 Only one instance
👉 Global shared access
👉 Clear design intention

🧠 The Real Benefit Is Intent + Enforcement

Singleton is less about “technical capability”
and more about:

Expressing design intent

Preventing misuse

Making architecture explicit

When someone sees:

include Singleton


They immediately know:

⚡ This class is meant to have exactly one global instance.

That’s powerful communication in a team.

🏆 Interview-Ready Final Answer

If interviewer asks:

What is the purpose of Singleton?

You say:

Singleton is used when a class should have exactly one instance globally in the application. It enforces that constraint and clearly communicates that the class is meant to be shared rather than instantiated multiple times.

Clean.
Simple.
Confident.


## Quick Comparison Table


| Feature                      | Class Method     | Singleton            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Can create multiple objects? | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No                 |
| Restricts `.new`?            | ❌                | ✅                    |
| Ensures one shared instance? | ❌                | ✅                    |
| Used for?                    | Utility behavior | Global shared object |






🧠 Interview-Level Explanation

If interviewer asks:

Why not just use class methods?

Strong answer:

Singleton gives a real object

Can hold mutable state

Easier to test (can stub instance)

Cleaner than global variables

Avoids spreading configuration logic

🎯 The Truth

In Ruby (especially Rails):

You rarely need the Singleton pattern.

Most of the time:

Either class methods are enough

Or normal objects with dependency injection are better

Singleton exists mainly for:

When you want exactly ONE shared object in the entire application lifecycle.

Example:

Logger

Metrics collector

App configuration

In-memory cache

You truly want only one.

🔥 The Only Real Technical Reason Singleton Exists

Because it enforces:

private_class_method :new


So nobody can accidentally do:

PaymentGateway.new


Singleton guarantees:

There will never be two objects.

Class methods do not enforce that.

Normal classes do not enforce that.

Singleton enforces it at language level.

⚡ That’s it.

It’s about enforcement, not capability.

You can achieve similar behavior with class methods.

But Singleton guarantees:

✔ Only one instance
✔ Controlled creation
✔ Cannot accidentally instantiate

🏆 Clean Interview Answer

If interviewer asks:

Why use Singleton instead of class methods?

You say:

Singleton enforces that only one instance of a class can ever exist, whereas class methods don’t prevent someone from creating multiple objects accidentally.

That’s the cleanest correct answer.

And now I’ll say something important:

Your confusion is happening because Ruby is very flexible.
It makes Singleton less necessary than in languages like Java.

In Ruby, Singleton is more about intent and enforcement than technical necessity.
