First, clear the terms (very important)
🔹 Sidekiq process

An OS process

Has its own PID

Has its own thread pool (e.g. 10 threads)

🔹 Sidekiq threads

Worker threads inside a process

Controlled by -c / concurrency

Example:

bundle exec sidekiq -c 10


👉 1 process × 10 threads

Can you start another process while Sidekiq is running?
✅ YES

You can start another Sidekiq process anytime:

bundle exec sidekiq -c 10


Now you have:

2 Sidekiq processes
20 total worker threads


No restart. No downtime.

How Sidekiq handles this internally
1️⃣ New process boots

Registers itself in Redis under processes

Starts heartbeating

Subscribes to queues

2️⃣ Redis becomes the coordinator

All processes pull from the same Redis queues

Atomic pop ensures:

No job is taken by two threads

3️⃣ Load is naturally shared

Any free thread from any process can take the next job

This is how Sidekiq scales horizontally 🚀

You scale Sidekiq by:

Adding more processes

Not by “restarting” anything

That’s why in production you often see:

web dynos
sidekiq dynos (multiple)

Example scenario (easy to visualize)

Before:

1 process
- PID 1111
- 10 threads


After starting another:

PID 1111 → 10 threads
PID 2222 → 10 threads
Total = 20 workers


Both visible in:

Sidekiq UI

Redis processes key

What you CANNOT do

❌ You cannot dynamically increase threads inside an existing process

Concurrency is fixed at boot

To increase threads:

# stop
# restart with higher -c
bundle exec sidekiq -c 20

Interview-ready answer 🔥

Yes, Sidekiq allows multiple processes to run concurrently. You can start additional Sidekiq processes at any time without restarting existing ones. Each process registers itself in Redis and shares the same job queues, enabling horizontal scaling.

Bonus (production tip)

Instead of manually starting processes:

Use systemd / Docker / Kubernetes / Heroku dynos

Scale Sidekiq workers independently of web servers
