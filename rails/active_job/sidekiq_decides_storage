hort answer: ❌ No. Redis does NOT decide this.
✔️ Sidekiq decides everything.

Redis is dumb storage. Sidekiq is the brain.

Who decides Redis data types?
❌ Redis does NOT

Choose list vs sorted set

Know what a “job” is

Know pending / retry / scheduled states

Move jobs between states

Redis only:

“You told me to LPUSH → I store a list.”

✔️ Sidekiq decides

Sidekiq’s Ruby code explicitly says:

Pending jobs → LIST

Retry jobs → SORTED SET

Scheduled jobs → SORTED SET

Dead jobs → SORTED SET

Running jobs → HASH / SET

Redis just executes commands.

Mapping: Job state → Redis data type

| Job State         | Who decided? | Redis Data Type | Redis Key      |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| Pending           | Sidekiq      | List            | `queue:<name>` |
| Scheduled         | Sidekiq      | Sorted Set      | `schedule`     |
| Retry             | Sidekiq      | Sorted Set      | `retry`        |
| Dead              | Sidekiq      | Sorted Set      | `dead`         |
| Running (monitor) | Sidekiq      | Hash            | `workers`      |
| Processes         | Sidekiq      | Set             | `processes`    |


FIFO queue

Fast push/pop

Atomic operations

Scheduled / Retry → SORTED SET

Time-based execution

Sorted by timestamp

Efficient polling

Running → HASH

Key-value structure

Easy to update heartbeats

Important mental model

Redis is like a hard disk
Sidekiq is the file system + OS

Redis doesn’t know:

what files are

what folders are

what a job is

Sidekiq defines the structure.

Interview-ready one-liner 💡

Redis does not decide job storage; Sidekiq explicitly chooses Redis data structures like lists and sorted sets based on job state. Redis simply stores whatever Sidekiq tells it to.

Bonus: Where this logic lives

In Sidekiq source code:

Sidekiq::Client

Sidekiq::Scheduled

Sidekiq::RetrySet

Sidekiq::DeadSet
