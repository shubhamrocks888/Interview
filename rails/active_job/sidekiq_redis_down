What happens if Redis goes down?

Remember one core fact first:

Redis is Sidekiq’s source of truth.
No Redis = no Sidekiq.

1️⃣ Enqueuing jobs (from Rails)
When Redis is DOWN:
MyJob.perform_async


👉 Fails immediately

Sidekiq tries to push job to Redis

Redis connection error occurs

Exception is raised

Typical error:

Redis::CannotConnectError

Result:

❌ Job is NOT queued
❌ Job is LOST unless you rescue/retry in app code

📌 Rails web server keeps running, but job enqueue fails.

2️⃣ Running jobs (Sidekiq workers)
Case A: Job is already running

Job continues executing in memory

Sidekiq does NOT need Redis during execution

BUT…

When job finishes:

Sidekiq tries to:

Acknowledge completion

Remove job metadata

👉 Redis is down → ACK fails

Result:

Job appears unfinished

On Redis recovery → job may be re-run

⚠️ This is why idempotency is critical.

3️⃣ Fetching new jobs

Redis is required to:

Pop jobs from queues

When Redis is down:
❌ No job fetching
❌ Worker threads go idle
❌ Sidekiq logs connection errors

Sidekiq does not crash immediately — it keeps retrying Redis connection.

4️⃣ Retry, Scheduled, Dead jobs

All of these live in Redis:

| Feature        | Impact          |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Retries        | ❌ Paused        |
| Scheduled jobs | ❌ Won’t run     |
| Cron jobs      | ❌ Won’t trigger |
| Dead set       | ❌ Inaccessible  |


Nothing moves until Redis comes back.

5️⃣ Sidekiq UI

Sidekiq UI is just a Redis viewer.

Redis down →
❌ UI broken
❌ No stats
❌ No retries / deletes

6️⃣ When Redis comes back up
What resumes automatically:

✅ Sidekiq reconnects
✅ Queues resume
✅ Scheduled jobs resume
✅ Crashed jobs are re-queued

What does NOT resume:

❌ Jobs that failed to enqueue during downtime
❌ Unless your app retried them

7️⃣ Worst-case scenario (important)

If Redis is:

Not persistent (no AOF / RDB)

And crashes hard

👉 All jobs are permanently lost

This is why production Redis must have persistence enabled.

8️⃣ How production systems protect against this
✅ Redis persistence

AOF (Append Only File)

RDB snapshots

✅ Redis HA

Redis Sentinel

Redis Cluster

Managed Redis (AWS ElastiCache, GCP, etc.)

✅ App-level protection
begin
  MyJob.perform_async
rescue Redis::BaseError
  # fallback / log / retry later
end

Interview-ready summary 🔥

If Redis goes down, Sidekiq cannot enqueue, fetch, retry, or track jobs. Running jobs may finish but won’t be acknowledged, so they can be re-run after Redis recovers. Once Redis is back, Sidekiq reconnects automatically and resumes processing. Jobs attempted during the outage are lost unless the application handles retries.

One-liner (if interviewer cuts you off)

Redis down means Sidekiq is effectively paused. No Redis, no background jobs.
