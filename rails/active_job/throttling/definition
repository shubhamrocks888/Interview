1️⃣ What is throttling? (plain English)

Throttling = controlling how fast something is allowed to happen

In software:

Limit how many requests / actions a user or system can do within a given time.

Think:

“Slow down, don’t overload me.”

2️⃣ Why do we need throttling?

Without throttling:

A single user can spam your API

Bots can DDoS your app

Database gets overloaded

CPU / memory spikes

Legit users suffer 😬

With throttling:

Fair usage

System stability

Protection from abuse

3️⃣ Real-life analogy 🛣️

Highway toll booth:

Cars allowed X per minute

Extra cars must wait

That’s throttling.

4️⃣ Throttling vs Rate Limiting (interview confusion)
Rate limiting

Hard cap

100 requests / minute
101st request → ❌ blocked

Throttling

Gradual slowing

1–50 req → fast
51–80 req → slower
81+ req → very slow / blocked


📌 Many people use the terms interchangeably — that’s okay in interviews unless they ask deeply.

5️⃣ Common places where throttling is used
1️⃣ APIs
POST /login → max 5 per minute
GET /search → max 100 per minute

2️⃣ Authentication

Login attempts

OTP resend

Password reset emails

3️⃣ Background jobs

Sending emails

Webhooks

Third-party API calls

6️⃣ Throttling in Rails (practical)
6.1 Rack::Attack (very common)
class Rack::Attack
  throttle('req/ip', limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.ip
  end
end


Meaning:

Max 300 requests

Per IP

Every 5 minutes

Extra requests → 429 Too Many Requests

6.2 Login throttling example
throttle('logins/ip', limit: 5, period: 1.minute) do |req|
  req.ip if req.path == '/login'
end


Stops brute-force attacks 🔒

7️⃣ Throttling using Redis (conceptual)

Very common interview answer:

key = "user:123:req_count"
INCR key
EXPIRE key 60


If count > limit → throttle

Why Redis?

Fast

Atomic

Shared across servers

8️⃣ Throttling vs Debouncing (frontend question)
Concept	Meaning
Throttling	Allow once every X time
Debouncing	Run only after activity stops

Example:

Scroll → throttle

Search input → debounce

9️⃣ Interview-ready definition 🎯

“Throttling is a technique used to control the rate of requests or actions over time to protect system resources and prevent abuse.”

🔟 Bonus: what happens when throttled?

Usually:

HTTP 429 status

Retry-After header

Delayed execution

1️⃣1️⃣ Common interview follow-ups

Be ready to answer:

Why Redis is preferred?

What happens in multi-server setup?

Difference between throttling and rate limiting?

What if Redis goes down?
