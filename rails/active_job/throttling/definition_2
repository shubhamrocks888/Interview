The correct understanding

❌ Not always “block extra requests”
✅ Control the rate of requests

Blocking is one possible outcome, not the definition.

Simple breakdown
Throttling means:

Regulating how frequently requests are processed over time

That regulation can result in:
1️⃣ Slowing requests
2️⃣ Delaying requests
3️⃣ Blocking requests (usually with 429)

Think in levels 🪜
Example: 100 requests / minute
Requests	What happens
1–60	Normal speed
61–90	Slower responses
91–100	Very slow
101+	Blocked (429)

👉 This is true throttling

What you’re thinking of (very common)
Rate limiting

Hard stop

100 requests / minute
101st request → BLOCK


This is what most Rails apps do using:

Rack::Attack

Nginx

API gateways

So your statement is partially correct.

Interview-safe answer (say this 👇)

“Throttling controls the rate of requests.
In practice, many systems implement it by blocking extra requests after a limit is exceeded.”

Perfect balance ✔️

One-line memory trick 🧠

Throttling → “Slow down”

Rate limiting → “Stop after limit”

Rails reality check 🛠️

In most Rails apps:

Throttling = block extra requests with 429

True gradual throttling is rare

So interviewers usually accept:

“Throttling blocks requests after a threshold.”

Just add one clarifying line and you’re golden.
