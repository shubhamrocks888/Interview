Sidekiq is a separate server/process, just like rails s is for your web app.

Mental model (lock this in)
Thing	Command	Purpose
Rails web server	rails s / puma	Handles HTTP requests
Sidekiq server	bundle exec sidekiq	Runs background jobs

They are independent processes.

How you start Sidekiq
Basic command
bundle exec sidekiq


That’s the equivalent of:

rails s


for background jobs.

With options (very common)
bundle exec sidekiq -c 10 -q default -q mailers


-c 10 → 10 threads

-q → queue priority/order

Using config file (production-style)
bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml


Example sidekiq.yml:

:concurrency: 10
:queues:
  - critical
  - default
  - low

What happens when you run bundle exec sidekiq

Boots Rails environment

Connects to Redis

Registers itself in Redis (processes)

Starts heartbeats

Starts worker threads

Begins fetching jobs

👉 All without touching rails s

Can Rails app work without Sidekiq running?

✅ Yes (for web requests)

But:

Background jobs will not execute

Jobs will pile up in Redis

Can Sidekiq run without Rails server?

✅ Yes

Sidekiq only needs:

Rails codebase

Redis

It doesn’t need rails s running

In production (important)

Usually you run:

multiple web servers

multiple Sidekiq servers

Example:

3 web servers (rails s / puma)
2 sidekiq servers (bundle exec sidekiq)


Totally independent scaling.

Interview-ready one-liner 🔥

Yes, Sidekiq runs as a separate server process. Just like rails s starts the web server, bundle exec sidekiq starts the Sidekiq worker server to process background jobs.
