1️⃣ Is perform a built-in function?
❌ No — YOU define perform
def perform(user)
end


perform is not implemented by you calling Rails

Rails expects your job class to define it

It is just a normal Ruby method

Think of it like:

“This is the method Rails will call when the job runs.”

If perform is missing → job crashes.

2️⃣ Then who calls perform?
Answer:

👉 Active Job calls perform internally

Flow:

perform_later
   ↓
Sidekiq worker
   ↓
ActiveJob::Base
   ↓
calls your perform(...)


You never call perform directly in real apps.

3️⃣ What about perform_now and perform_later?
✅ These ARE built-in methods

They come from:

ActiveJob::Base


Your job inherits them via:

ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base

4️⃣ What does perform_now do?
WelcomeEmailJob.perform_now(user)

Meaning:

Runs immediately

Runs in the same thread

NO Redis

NO Sidekiq

Blocks the request

Equivalent to:

WelcomeEmailJob.new.perform(user)


Use case:

Debugging

Console

Very small tasks

5️⃣ What does perform_later do?
WelcomeEmailJob.perform_later(user)

Meaning:

Enqueues job

Sends job to queue adapter (Sidekiq)

Stores job in Redis

Returns immediately

Job runs asynchronously

This is what you use 99% of the time.

6️⃣ Where exactly are these methods defined?
Method	Defined in
perform	Your job class
perform_now	ActiveJob
perform_later	ActiveJob
queue_as	ActiveJob
7️⃣ Execution timeline (important)
perform_later
Controller
  ↓
perform_later
  ↓
Active Job serializes args
  ↓
Push to Redis
  ↓
Sidekiq worker
  ↓
perform(user)

perform_now
Controller
  ↓
perform_now
  ↓
perform(user)

8️⃣ Important warning about arguments ⚠️

Your code:

def perform(user)
end


This works, but is NOT recommended.

Why?

Jobs are serialized

Passing full objects can break

Object may be stale

Best practice:
def perform(user_id)
  user = User.find(user_id)
end


Interviewers LOVE this.

9️⃣ deliver_now vs deliver_later inside job

Inside a job:

deliver_now  # ✅ preferred
deliver_later # ❌ creates nested job


Reason:

You’re already in background

No need to enqueue again

🔟 Interview-ready summary (memorize)

💬 Is perform built-in?
➡️ No, developers define it.

💬 Who calls perform?
➡️ Active Job via the queue adapter.

💬 Where do perform_now and perform_later come from?
➡️ ActiveJob::Base.

💬 Difference?
➡️ perform_now runs inline, perform_later enqueues.

🧠 One-line mental model

You write perform; Rails gives you perform_now and perform_later.
