Short, direct answer

❌ No — the job is NOT stored inside a Redis hash keyed by jid.

✔️ The job is stored as a raw JSON string value inside different Redis data structures (list / sorted set), and jid is just a field inside that JSON.

There is no Redis key like:

job:<jid> -> {job data}

How Redis actually stores the job
Example job JSON (string)
"{\"class\":\"MyJob\",\"args\":[1],\"jid\":\"a1b2c3\",\"queue\":\"default\"}"


This entire string is the value stored in Redis.

1️⃣ Pending job (queue)
Redis structure
LIST

Redis key
queue:default

Stored like this
LPUSH queue:default "<job_json_string>"


👉 Each list element = one full job JSON

No hash. No jid-based key.

2️⃣ Scheduled / Retry job
Redis structure
SORTED SET (ZSET)

Redis key
schedule
retry

Stored like this
ZADD retry <timestamp> "<job_json_string>"


Score = run time

Member = full job JSON

Again: job JSON is the member itself.

3️⃣ Dead (failed permanently)
Redis structure
SORTED SET

Redis key
dead

ZADD dead <timestamp> "<job_json_string>"

4️⃣ Running job (monitoring only)

Here jid does appear in a hash — but this is NOT job storage.

Redis structure
HASH

Redis key
workers


Example:

HSET workers "pid:thread" "<job_json_string>"


Purpose:

Web UI

Heartbeats

Graceful shutdown

⚠️ If the process crashes, this entry disappears.

Key distinction (very important)

| Redis Data      | Purpose            | Persistent? |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| `queue:*` list  | Job waiting to run | ✅           |
| `retry` ZSET    | Retry later        | ✅           |
| `schedule` ZSET | Run later          | ✅           |
| `dead` ZSET     | Failed jobs        | ✅           |
| `workers` hash  | Currently running  | ❌           |


So where is jid stored?

Inside the JSON itself:

{
  "jid": "a1b2c3"
}


That’s it.

Redis does not:

Index jobs by jid

Look up jobs by jid

Store job separately per jid

Why Sidekiq chose this design?
Performance & memory efficiency

Redis excels at pushing/popping lists

Indexing by jid would double storage

Most jobs are fire-and-forget

Interview-ready one-liner 💡

Sidekiq stores the entire job as a single JSON string inside Redis lists or sorted sets; jid is just metadata inside that JSON and is not used as a Redis key or hash index.
