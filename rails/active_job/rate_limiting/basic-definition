What is Rate Limiting?

Rate Limiting = controlling how often a job can be executed within a time window.

Why it’s needed:

You don’t want a user to spam API calls that enqueue jobs

Sending too many emails too quickly may get you blacklisted by SMTP providers

External API calls often have per-minute/hour limits
