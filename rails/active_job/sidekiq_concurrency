1️⃣ concurrency in Sidekiq
Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.options[:concurrency] = 10
end


Concurrency = number of threads per Sidekiq process that can execute jobs in parallel.

It does not mean 10 separate OS processes (unless you run multiple Sidekiq processes).

Each thread can pick a job from a queue and execute it simultaneously.

2️⃣ What actually happens

If concurrency = 10, Sidekiq can process up to 10 jobs at the same time in one process.

If you enqueue 20 jobs:

10 will run in parallel

The rest will wait in the Redis queue until a thread becomes free

Visual example
Sidekiq process (concurrency: 4)

Thread 1 → Job A
Thread 2 → Job B
Thread 3 → Job C
Thread 4 → Job D
Queue → Job E, Job F, Job G …


Once any thread finishes, the next job in the queue starts immediately.

3️⃣ Important notes

Threads share memory inside the same Ruby process.

High concurrency can be limited by:

Ruby GIL (for MRI)

Redis connection pool size

Job workload (CPU vs IO)

If you want more parallelism, you can run multiple Sidekiq processes.

4️⃣ Interview-ready one-liner 💡

config.options[:concurrency] = 10 means that a single Sidekiq process can execute up to 10 jobs in parallel using threads, not separate OS processes.
