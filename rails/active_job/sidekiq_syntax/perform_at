🕒 What is a Unix timestamp?

A Unix timestamp is:

The number of seconds elapsed since
January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC

This moment is called the Unix Epoch.

📌 Example timestamps
Date & Time (UTC)	Unix timestamp
Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00	0
Jan 1, 1970 00:05:00	300
Jan 1, 2026 10:00:00	1700000000 (approx)

So when Sidekiq sees a number, it assumes:

“This is a Unix timestamp”

🔍 Now connect it to perform_at(5.minutes)
5.minutes
# => 300


So this code:

perform_at(5.minutes)


is interpreted as:

perform_at(300)


Meaning:

Run this job at Unix time = 300
→ Jan 1, 1970, 00:05:00 UTC

That time is decades in the past ⏪

🚨 What does Sidekiq do with a past timestamp?

Sidekiq logic is roughly:

if run_at <= Time.now
  run_now
end


So:

Timestamp is in the past

Job is immediately eligible

Job executes right away

❌ Not 5 minutes later
❌ Very sneaky bug

✅ Correct ways to use perform_at
perform_at(Time.now + 5.minutes)
perform_at(5.minutes.from_now)


Both pass an absolute time, not a duration.

🧠 Mental shortcut to remember

If you pass a number to perform_at, Sidekiq assumes it is seconds since 1970.

🎯 Interview one-liner

A Unix timestamp is the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970 UTC, and Sidekiq interprets numeric arguments to perform_at as absolute timestamps.

TL;DR

Unix timestamp = seconds since 1970

5.minutes = 300

perform_at(300) = Jan 1, 1970

Job runs immediately ❌

Use perform_in or perform_at(Time)
