The line
Address = Struct.new(:street, :city)


means:

Create a lightweight Ruby class called Address with two attributes: street and city.

Under the hood, Ruby is doing something very close to this:

class Address
  attr_accessor :street, :city

  def initialize(street, city)
    @street = street
    @city = city
  end
end


But in one line.

How you use it
address = Address.new("MG Road", "Bangalore")

address.street  # => "MG Road"
address.city    # => "Bangalore"

address.street = "Brigade Road"

Why people use Struct (especially in Rails)

Structs are used when you need:

✅ A simple data object
✅ No database table
✅ No ActiveRecord overhead
✅ Clean, readable code

Common Rails use cases:

Service objects

API response mapping

Value objects

Temporary objects in controllers/jobs

Form objects (sometimes)

Example in Rails service:

Result = Struct.new(:success?, :data, :error)

def call
  Result.new(true, user, nil)
end

Struct vs ActiveRecord (important for interviews)
Struct	ActiveRecord
In-memory object	DB-backed
No validations by default	Validations
Very fast	Slower (DB)
No callbacks	Callbacks
Lightweight	Heavy

👉 Struct ≠ Model

Rails-y improvement (keyword arguments)

Ruby allows keyword initialization:

Address = Struct.new(:street, :city, keyword_init: true)

Address.new(street: "MG Road", city: "Bangalore")


This is very common in modern Rails apps.

When NOT to use Struct

❌ If you need:

DB persistence

Validations

Callbacks

Associations

Then use ActiveRecord instead.
