✅ Better Professional Version

You can explain it like:

In one of our applications, we noticed unusually high traffic patterns where certain clients were making thousands of API requests per minute. This could potentially degrade system performance and impact legitimate users. To safeguard the system, I implemented IP-based rate limiting middleware that restricts the number of requests allowed per IP within a defined time window.

That sounds calm and senior.

🎯 If They Ask: Why Middleware for This?

You say:

I implemented it at the middleware layer because it allows us to intercept requests at the Rack level before they hit the controller or database. This prevents unnecessary resource usage and protects the application from abuse.

Mentioning the Rack layer inside Ruby on Rails makes it stronger.

💡 Even More Mature Version (Very Impressive)

Instead of blaming “hackers”, say:

Rate limiting is not only for malicious users. Sometimes legitimate clients or buggy integrations can accidentally flood the system. Implementing rate limiting ensures fair usage and system stability.

🔥 This is senior-level thinking.

⚠️ Important Interview Tip

If you say:

from different IPs

Be careful.

Basic IP rate limiting won’t stop distributed attacks.

If interviewer challenges you:

You respond confidently:

Yes, IP-based limiting helps with simple abuse patterns. For distributed attacks, we would combine it with reverse proxy rate limiting (like at Nginx or CDN level) and possibly user-based rate limiting.

That answer = very strong.

🚀 Final Polished Answer You Can Memorize

We implemented middleware-based rate limiting to protect the system from excessive traffic. It restricts the number of requests per IP within a fixed time window and returns a 429 response if exceeded. Since it operates at the Rack layer, it blocks requests before they reach controllers or the database, improving performance and protecting application resources.

Clean. Confident. Professional.
