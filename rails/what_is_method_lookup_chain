1️⃣ BasicObject — the absolute root
BasicObject

What it is

The parent of everything in Ruby

Has almost nothing in it

No puts, no inspect, no class, no nil?

Why it exists

For very minimal objects

Used internally and for DSLs

Example
BasicObject.instance_methods
# => [:__send__, :__id__]


💡 Rails sometimes uses this to avoid method name conflicts.

2️⃣ Kernel — global methods live here
Kernel

What it is

A module, not a class

Mixed into Object

Gives you “global” methods

Methods you use every day
puts
print
p
loop
sleep
require
raise
rand

Why puts works without a receiver

Because:

Object.include Kernel


So every object has Kernel methods.

3️⃣ Object — default parent of all classes
Object

What it is

Parent of almost every Ruby class

Where most common methods live

Common methods
to_s
inspect
nil?
present? (Rails)
blank?   (Rails)
== 
class
is_a?

Example
class User
end

User.superclass
# => Object

🔗 Full hierarchy (simplified)
BasicObject
   ↑
Object
   ↑
User


And Kernel is mixed into Object:

Kernel (module)
   ↓
Object
   ↓
User

🔍 Method lookup chain (no modules)

When Ruby looks for a method:

User
 ↓
Object
 ↓
Kernel
 ↓
BasicObject

🧠 Why this matters (real-world)
1️⃣ Explains “magic” methods

Why this works:

puts "hello"


Because:

puts → Kernel → Object → available everywhere

2️⃣ Helps with debugging overrides

If you override to_s, you’re overriding a method from Object.

3️⃣ Important for prepend / include

Understanding this chain explains:

monkey patching

Rails concerns

ActiveSupport magic

🎯 Interview-ready one-liner

BasicObject is the minimal root class, Object is the default superclass that provides common behavior, and Kernel is a module mixed into Object that provides global methods like puts.
