1️⃣ TDD (Test-Driven Development)
Definition

Write tests first, then code to make them pass.

Focus is on how code works.

Usually unit tests.

Workflow
Red → Green → Refactor


Write a failing test

Write code to pass the test

Refactor and repeat

Example (Ruby / RSpec)
# tdd: test first
RSpec.describe Calculator do
  it "adds two numbers" do
    calc = Calculator.new
    expect(calc.add(2,3)).to eq(5)
  end
end

# Then write code to pass
class Calculator
  def add(a,b)
    a + b
  end
end


✅ Key point: focus is on method functionality, not human-readable behavior.

🔹 2️⃣ BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
Definition

Write tests as behavior specifications

Focus is on what the system should do from a user or business perspective

Usually more readable, often called specs

Workflow

Write behavior description → implement code → tests pass

Example (Ruby / RSpec)
RSpec.describe "User login" do
  it "allows a registered user to log in" do
    user = User.create(email: "test@example.com", password: "123456")

    login_result = UserAuthenticator.new(user.email, "123456").login

    expect(login_result).to eq("Login successful")
  end
end


✅ Key point: focus is on behavior, not just the method’s implementation.

Tests read like a specification

🔹 TDD vs BDD (Side by Side)

| Aspect      | TDD                              | BDD                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Focus       | Correct implementation of code   | Behavior and outcomes                            |
| Test style  | Unit test / technical            | Spec / business-readable                         |
| Example     | `expect(calc.add(2,3)).to eq(5)` | `expect(login_result).to eq("Login successful")` |
| Goal        | Ensure code works                | Ensure code behaves correctly for user/business  |
| Readability | Developer-focused                | Stakeholder-focused                              |
| Tools       | RSpec, Minitest                  | RSpec, Cucumber, Capybara                        |

🔹 Memory trick

TDD = Test what your code does

BDD = Specify what the user expects

🔹 Interview one-liner

TDD focuses on writing tests to guide code implementation, while BDD focuses on writing human-readable specifications that describe expected behavior.
