🔹 Final Conclusion

Never blindly rescue StandardError

It covers programmer mistakes like NoMethodError, NameError, ArgumentError

Rescuing it hides real bugs → silent failures, inconsistent data, broken monitoring

Always rescue only what’s expected / recoverable

Examples: ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, RecordInvalid, Payment::Failed, Net::ReadTimeout

Let unexpected errors bubble up so Rails logs them and monitoring tools (Sentry, Bugsnag) report them

Pro tip for Rails APIs:

Use rescue_from in controllers for expected errors

Use rescue => e in service objects only for specific exceptions

Always log or report critical errors

🏁 Perfect Interview Answer (30 sec)

“I never rescue StandardError blindly because it includes programmer mistakes. I only rescue specific, expected errors that I can handle gracefully, and let unexpected errors bubble up so they can be logged, reported, and fixed.”
