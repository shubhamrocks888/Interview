This is a killer interview question — and interviewers really care about the reasoning, not just the rule.

Here’s the clean, convincing answer you should give.

❓ Why NOT rescue StandardError blindly?
❌ Example of bad code
begin
  do_something
rescue StandardError
end


(or even worse)

rescue
end

🚨 1️⃣ It hides real bugs (BIGGEST reason)

StandardError includes:

NoMethodError

NameError

ArgumentError

TypeError

These are programmer mistakes, not recoverable errors.

What happens?

Bug occurs

Error is silently swallowed

App continues in broken state

No logs, no alerts 😬

🎯 Interview line:

“It hides bugs that should crash loudly.”

🚨 2️⃣ Makes debugging nearly impossible

No stack trace

No error logs

Production issues become ghost bugs

🎯 Interview line:

“Silent failures are harder than crashes.”

🚨 3️⃣ Can corrupt data
Order.transaction do
  order.save!
  payment.charge!
rescue StandardError
end

What can happen?

Order partially saved

Payment maybe charged

Transaction may or may not rollback

System enters inconsistent state

🎯 Interview line:

“Swallowing errors can leave data inconsistent.”

🚨 4️⃣ Breaks retry & monitoring systems

Sidekiq retries on raised exceptions

Sentry reports raised exceptions

If you rescue everything:

❌ No retry

❌ No alert

❌ Job marked as successful

🎯 Interview line:

“Rescuing prevents retries and error reporting.”

🚨 5️⃣ Violates fail-fast principle

Good systems:

Fail early

Fail loudly

Fail visibly

Blind rescue does the opposite.

🎯 Interview line:

“Unexpected errors should fail fast.”

✅ When IS it okay to rescue StandardError?

Only if you do ALL of these:

rescue StandardError => e
  Rails.logger.error(e.message)
  Sentry.capture_exception(e)
  raise
end


👉 Log
👉 Report
👉 Re-raise

🎯 Interview line:

“If I rescue StandardError, I always re-raise.”

✅ What you SHOULD rescue instead

Rescue specific, expected exceptions:

rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
rescue Payment::Failed
rescue Net::ReadTimeout


🎯 Interview line:

“I only rescue exceptions I know how to handle.”

🧠 PERFECT INTERVIEW ANSWER (Say this)

“Rescuing StandardError blindly hides real bugs, breaks retries and monitoring, and can leave the system in an inconsistent state. I only rescue specific, expected exceptions and let unexpected ones crash so they can be fixed.”
