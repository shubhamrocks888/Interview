🧠 Golden Rule

Log locally OR report to Sentry OR both — depending on who needs to see the error.

Not all exceptions deserve double noise.

1️⃣ When you SHOULD use both (✅ correct)
👉 Production, critical paths, unexpected failures
rescue StandardError => e
  Rails.logger.error(e.message)
  Sentry.capture_exception(e)
  raise
end


Use both when:

Payments

Orders

Money / data integrity

Infra / external services

Truly unexpected bugs

Why both?

Rails.logger → quick server debugging

Sentry → alerts, stack traces, trends

🎯 Interview line:

“For critical production issues, I log and report.”

2️⃣ When you should use ONLY Sentry (✅ best practice)

Sentry already logs stack trace + message.

rescue StandardError => e
  Sentry.capture_exception(e)
  raise
end


Use this when:

Logs are noisy

You rely on centralized monitoring

Exception already appears in logs elsewhere

🎯 Interview line:

“Sentry already captures context, so logging again can be redundant.”

3️⃣ When you should use ONLY Rails.logger (✅ very common)
Expected / recoverable errors
rescue Net::ReadTimeout => e
  Rails.logger.warn("Timeout while calling payment API")
end


Examples:

External API timeouts

Validation failures

User errors

Retryable conditions

🎯 Interview line:

“Expected errors don’t need alerting.”

4️⃣ When you should use NEITHER (😎 senior-level)

Some errors are:

User-driven

Business logic outcomes

rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  head :not_found
end


No logging.
No Sentry.
No noise.

🎯 Interview line:

“Not every exception is an error.”

🚫 What NOT to do (interview red flag)
rescue StandardError => e
  Rails.logger.error(e.message)
  Sentry.capture_exception(e)
end


❌ No re-raise
❌ Job marked successful
❌ Silent failure

🎯 Interviewer hears: junior dev

🔥 Clean decision table (memorize this)

| Scenario                | Logger | Sentry | Raise |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Unexpected prod bug     | ✅      | ✅      | ✅     |
| Critical background job | ❌      | ✅      | ✅     |
| Expected business error | ✅      | ❌      | ❌     |
| User input issue        | ❌      | ❌      | ❌     |
| External API flaky      | ✅      | ❌      | ❌     |


🧠 PERFECT INTERVIEW ANSWER

“No, I don’t log and send to Sentry every time. I log expected errors, alert on unexpected ones, and only combine both for critical failures. Over-logging creates noise.”
