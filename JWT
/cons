1️⃣ Hard to revoke (BIGGEST con)
❌ Problem

JWT is stateless.

Once issued:

JWT valid until exp


You cannot revoke it unless:

You wait for expiry ❌

You add server-side tracking ❌ (breaks statelessness)

🔥 Real example

User logs out

JWT still works until expiry

Token stolen → attacker keeps access

2️⃣ Logout is basically fake 😬

With JWT:

Logout = “delete token on client”

Server doesn’t know

Compare:

Devise	JWT
Destroy session	True logout
Invalidate immediately	❌
3️⃣ Token size (bloated headers)

JWT contains:

Header

Payload

Signature

Even small JWT ≈ 800–1500 bytes

Every request:

Authorization: Bearer <big_token>


📉 Impacts:

Network overhead

Mobile data

CDN cache efficiency

4️⃣ No built-in rotation / refresh safety
❌ Access token expiry dilemma

Long expiry → security risk

Short expiry → bad UX

You need:

Refresh tokens

Rotation logic

Blacklisting

Extra DB tables

JWT alone doesn’t solve this.

5️⃣ Storage security issues (frontend)

Where do you store JWT?

Location	Risk
localStorage	❌ XSS
sessionStorage	❌ XSS
Cookie	CSRF risk

JWT often moves security burden to frontend.

6️⃣ Payload is readable (not encrypted)

People think:

“JWT is secure”

❌ Wrong.

base64(payload) → readable


So:

No PII

No secrets

No internal data

JWT gives integrity, not confidentiality.

7️⃣ Algorithm confusion & misconfig risks

Common mistakes:

Accepting alg: none

Mixing HS256 / RS256 incorrectly

Using same secret everywhere

Many real-world breaches happened due to JWT misconfiguration.

8️⃣ Clock & expiry issues

JWT depends on:

exp, iat, nbf


Problems:

Clock skew between servers

Expired token but client still sending

Hard to debug production issues

9️⃣ Hard to change auth rules

Once token is issued:

Role changed ❌

Permissions updated ❌

Account suspended ❌

JWT still authorizes until expiry.

You must:

Short expiry

Or check DB on every request (again breaking statelessness)

🔟 Not ideal for web apps with browsers

JWT shines for:

Mobile apps

Service-to-service

APIs

But for browsers:

Cookies + sessions are simpler

CSRF protection is mature

Immediate logout is possible

That’s why Devise ≠ JWT by default.

1️⃣1️⃣ Summary table (interview gold)

| Problem          | JWT   |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Stateless        | ✅     |
| Revocation       | ❌     |
| Logout           | Weak  |
| Token size       | Large |
| Payload secrecy  | ❌     |
| Browser-friendly | ❌     |
| Complexity       | High  |

1️⃣2️⃣ Interview-ready closing line 🎯

JWT is great for stateless distributed systems, but it introduces challenges around revocation, logout, token storage, and security. For traditional web apps, session-based authentication is often simpler and safer.
