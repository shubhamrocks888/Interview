First: The core problem JWT signature solves
Question:

If anyone can read the JWT payload, what stops a hacker from changing it?

Example token payload:

{
  "user_id": 1,
  "role": "user"
}


Attacker changes it to:

{
  "user_id": 1,
  "role": "admin"
}


⚠️ This is where signature comes in

What is JWT Signature (Plain English)

Signature is a tamper-proof seal created by the server
that proves “this token was created by me and not changed.”

Think of it like:

Wax seal on an envelope

Bank stamp on a cheque

You can read the content,
but you cannot alter it without breaking the seal.

How signature is created (NO MATH, just logic)
Server has a secret key
SECRET = "my_super_secret"

Step 1: Server creates header + payload
base64(header) + "." + base64(payload)

Step 2: Server signs it using secret
signature = hash(data + SECRET)


⚠️ The secret is never shared

Why attacker cannot fake it

Attacker can:
✔ Read header
✔ Read payload

Attacker cannot:
❌ Create a valid signature (no secret)

So if attacker changes payload:

header.payload.signature ❌


Signature verification fails → request rejected

How server verifies signature (Very Important)

When request comes in:

1️⃣ Server takes (header + payload) from token
2️⃣ Uses same secret
3️⃣ Recreates signature
4️⃣ Compares with token’s signature

✔ Same → token trusted
❌ Different → token rejected

Tiny Real Example
Original payload
{
  "user_id": 1
}


Signature created with secret:

abc123 ✔

Attacker changes payload
{
  "user_id": 2
}


But signature still:

abc123 ❌


Mismatch → 401 Unauthorized

What signature DOES and DOES NOT do
Signature DOES:

✔ Prevent tampering
✔ Prove token authenticity
✔ Enable stateless verification

Signature DOES NOT:

❌ Encrypt data
❌ Hide user info
❌ Protect against token theft

Interview one-liner (IMPORTANT)

JWT signature ensures the token’s integrity. If the payload is modified, the signature verification fails, so the server rejects the token.

Common confusion cleared
❓ Is signature encryption?

❌ No — hashing + signing

❓ Can someone generate JWT without secret?

❌ They can generate, but server won’t trust it

❓ Why not encrypt instead?

Encryption hides data;
signature protects trust.

JWT focuses on trust, not secrecy.

Very simple mental model (remember this)
Payload = letter
Signature = wax seal
Secret key = unique stamp


Broken seal → throw letter away.

10-second answer for interviewer

The JWT signature prevents tampering. It is generated using the token data and a server-side secret. When the token is received, the server re-creates the signature and rejects the token if it doesn’t match.
