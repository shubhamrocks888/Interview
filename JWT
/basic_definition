What is JWT? (Very Simple)

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a stateless authentication mechanism
used to prove who the user is after login.

📌 Instead of storing session data on the server,
the user carries the proof (token) on every request.

One-line interview definition ⭐

JWT is a compact, stateless token used for securely transmitting authentication information between client and server.

Why JWT is needed (Problem → Solution)
Without JWT (Session-based auth)

Server stores session in memory / Redis

Scaling servers becomes harder

Session lookup needed on every request

With JWT

Server does not store session

Token itself contains user identity

Easy to scale across microservices

JWT Structure (VERY IMPORTANT)

A JWT has 3 parts, separated by dots (.):

xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

1️⃣ Header
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}


Algorithm used for signing

Token type

2️⃣ Payload (Claims)
{
  "user_id": 42,
  "email": "user@test.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1700000000
}


User data

exp = expiry time (important!)

Base64 encoded, NOT encrypted

⚠️ Never put passwords here

3️⃣ Signature
HMACSHA256(
  base64(header) + "." + base64(payload),
  secret_key
)


Ensures token was not tampered

Created using server secret

JWT = Header + Payload + Signature

📌 Anyone can read JWT,
but only server can verify it.

JWT Authentication Flow (Step by Step)
1️⃣ User logs in
POST /login

2️⃣ Server verifies credentials
user = User.authenticate(email, password)

3️⃣ Server generates JWT
payload = { user_id: user.id, exp: 24.hours.from_now.to_i }
token = JWT.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY)

4️⃣ Client stores JWT

Browser → localStorage / cookie

Mobile app → secure storage

5️⃣ Client sends JWT on every request
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

6️⃣ Server verifies JWT
decoded = JWT.decode(token, SECRET_KEY)[0]
current_user = User.find(decoded["user_id"])


✔ If valid → allow request
❌ If expired/tampered → 401 Unauthorized

JWT in Microservices (Very Important)

JWT shines here ⭐

Client → API Gateway → User Service → Order Service → Payment Service


User logs in once

JWT is verified by any service

No shared session store

👉 Stateless authentication

JWT vs Sessions (Interview Favorite)
| Feature        | Session | JWT    |
| -------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Server storage | Yes     | No     |
| Stateless      | ❌       | ✅      |
| Scalability    | Hard    | Easy   |
| Logout         | Easy    | Hard   |
| Token size     | Small   | Larger |

JWT Pros

✔ Stateless
✔ Scales well
✔ Great for microservices
✔ No DB lookup per request

JWT Cons (Must Mention)

❌ Cannot easily revoke token
❌ Token theft = access until expiry
❌ Payload is readable
❌ Larger request size

How do we handle Logout with JWT?

Since server doesn’t store session:

✔ Short expiry (exp)
✔ Refresh tokens
✔ Token blacklist (Redis)
✔ Rotate signing keys

JWT Security Best Practices (Say This)

Always use HTTPS

Keep expiry short

Use refresh tokens

Store JWT in HttpOnly cookies

Never store sensitive data

Common Interview Questions & Answers
Q: Is JWT encrypted?

❌ No, encoded + signed, not encrypted

Q: Can JWT be tampered?

❌ No, signature validation fails

Q: Where do you store JWT?

Browser: HttpOnly cookie

Mobile: Secure storage

Q: JWT vs OAuth?

JWT = token format

OAuth = authorization framework

30-Second Interview Answer (Memorize)

JWT is a stateless authentication mechanism where the server issues a signed token after login. The token contains user identity and expiry, and the client sends it with every request. The server verifies the signature instead of storing session data, which makes JWT ideal for scalable and microservices-based systems.
