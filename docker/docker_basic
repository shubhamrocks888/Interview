1️⃣ What is Docker (1-liner)

Docker packages an application and its dependencies into a container so it runs the same everywhere.

2️⃣ Why use Docker on AWS?

Without Docker:

“Works on my machine” problem

Environment mismatch (Ruby, Erlang, OS, libs)

With Docker:

Same container runs on local → staging → production

Easy scaling & deployment

Perfect fit for cloud infra

3️⃣ How Docker is used on AWS (Most Common Ways)
🔹 Option 1: EC2 + Docker (Most common & simplest)
EC2 instance
 └── Docker
      ├── Rails container
      ├── Elixir/Phoenix container
      └── Sidekiq / Worker container


You manage EC2

You install Docker

You run containers manually or via scripts

📌 Very common in startups & mid-size teams

🔹 Option 2: ECS (Elastic Container Service)

AWS-managed container orchestration

AWS manages scheduling containers

Works with EC2 or Fargate

No need to SSH into servers

📌 Often asked in interviews as “next step after EC2 + Docker”

🔹 Option 3: EKS (Kubernetes)

Managed Kubernetes on AWS

Complex but powerful

Usually not expected unless JD mentions Kubernetes

4️⃣ Typical Docker Flow on AWS (Interview-Friendly)

1️⃣ Build Docker image locally
2️⃣ Push image to ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
3️⃣ EC2 / ECS pulls image
4️⃣ Container runs app

Code → Docker Image → ECR → EC2/ECS → Running App

5️⃣ Real Example (Rails / Elixir)
Rails

Container 1 → Rails API

Container 2 → Sidekiq

RDS → Database

S3 → File storage

Elixir

Container → Phoenix app

Handles high concurrency with BEAM processes

Docker just packages it

6️⃣ Why Docker fits Elixir & Ruby well
Ruby / Elixir Problem	Docker Solution
Dependency conflicts	Container isolation
Deployment issues	Same image everywhere
Scaling	Run more containers
CI/CD	Easy Jenkins integration
7️⃣ Pros & Cons (Interview Simple)
✅ Pros

Consistent environment

Faster deployments

Easy scaling

Works well with CI/CD

❌ Cons

Added complexity

Needs orchestration for large systems

Debugging containers can be harder

8️⃣ Interview-Perfect Answer (Memorize)

“We use Docker on AWS to containerize our Ruby and Elixir applications so they run consistently across environments. Docker images are built and stored in ECR, and containers are run on EC2 or ECS, which simplifies deployment, scaling, and CI/CD.”
