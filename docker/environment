What does “environment” mean here?

Environment = the place + setup where your application runs

It includes everything around your code.

An environment consists of:

Operating system (Linux version)

Language runtime (Ruby version, Elixir/Erlang version)

System libraries

App dependencies (gems, hex packages)

Environment variables

Configuration (ports, paths, memory)

Common environments in real projects
1️⃣ Local (Developer machine)

Your laptop

Ruby 3.2, Elixir 1.15 (maybe)

Mac/Linux differences

Manual setup

2️⃣ Staging / QA

AWS EC2

Similar to production

Used for testing before release

3️⃣ Production

Real users

High traffic

Strict configs

Needs stability

The classic problem (before Docker)

“It works on my machine but not in production.”

Why?

Different OS

Different Ruby / Elixir version

Missing system libraries

Different dependency versions

How Docker fixes this

Docker packages the environment itself.

Docker Image =
  OS layer +
  Language runtime +
  Dependencies +
  Your app


So:

Same Docker image runs on:

Your laptop

EC2

ECS

No surprises

No mismatch

Simple analogy (Interview-friendly)

Docker is like shipping a ready-made kitchen, not just the recipe.

Wherever you place the kitchen, the food tastes the same 🍽️

Interview-Perfect Explanation (Memorize)

“By environment, we mean the OS, runtime, dependencies, and configuration where the application runs. Docker packages all of these together, so the same container runs consistently across local, staging, and production environments.”

Bonus (If interviewer probes deeper)

You can add:

“This consistency reduces deployment bugs, simplifies CI/CD, and makes scaling easier because every instance runs the exact same environment.”

Short Answer (Interview One-Liner)

Docker does not run Linux containers directly on Windows.
On Windows, Docker runs inside a lightweight Linux VM, so Linux containers still run on Linux.

What actually happens (Step by Step)
Your machine

OS: Windows

Your container

Base image: Linux (e.g. ubuntu, alpine)

How Docker handles this
Windows
 └── Docker Desktop
       └── Lightweight Linux VM (WSL2 / Hyper-V)
            └── Linux kernel
                 └── Docker containers


So:

Containers still use Linux kernel

Windows just hosts a Linux VM

Why this is necessary

Linux containers need a Linux kernel

Containers are not full VMs

They share the host OS kernel

👉 Since Windows kernel ≠ Linux kernel
👉 Docker creates a Linux VM on Windows

On AWS EC2 (Linux)

On EC2:

OS is already Linux

Docker runs directly

No VM needed

EC2 (Linux)
 └── Docker
      └── Containers


That’s why Docker is faster and lighter on Linux servers.

Important Interview Clarification
❌ Wrong belief

“Docker containers are OS-agnostic”

✅ Correct statement

Docker images are OS-specific (Linux vs Windows),
but Docker provides compatibility using a VM when needed.

Interview-Perfect Answer (Memorize)

“Linux containers require a Linux kernel. On Windows, Docker runs inside a lightweight Linux VM using WSL2 or Hyper-V. On AWS EC2, since the OS is already Linux, Docker runs containers directly without a VM.”

Bonus: If interviewer asks further

Q: Can Windows containers run on Linux EC2?
A: ❌ No — Windows containers need Windows OS.
